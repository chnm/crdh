In this article, I adopted a digital humanities approach to study Louis XIV's painting collection, exploring the location of iconographic themes in the private and public spaces inhabited by the French king in Versailles. For that, I researched and classified the paintings belonging to the *Cabinet des Tableaux* of the king, which were collected in Versailles after 1671, when the first part of the *Cabinet* was established in the palace. The painting collection ---that constituted a fraction of his and the Crown's general art collection--- was so extensive that only the plain citation of all the *œuvres*' titles would take more than 5000 words. Moreover, the consistency of the collection at the times of Louis XIV reached a complexity that its formation's assessment has required the study of specific temporal and physical segments. The paintings are scattered, their location often changed, and the written sources about them, though plentiful, are sometimes contradictory. A digital humanities approach can aid in relating images to written documents and vice-versa, which can help us visualize relationships between these different historical sources, especially relationships that have not yet been considered. Moreover, such relations can also be interrogated as a meta-source that can help validate the historical macro perspective alongside the micro-analysis.

### From texts to images

The primary sources are mainly the inventories compiled by the *peintres du roi*: the anonymous *Mémoire des tableaux qui sont posés dans les appartements du château de Versailles. Du premier novembre 1695*[^1]; André Félibien's *Tableaux du Cabinet du Roy*[^2]*;* Charles Le Brun's *Inventaire des Tableaux du Cabinet du Roy* of 1683[^3] (**Fig. 1**); Jean-Aimar Piganiol de La Force's three editions of his *Nouvelle description des chateaux et parcs de Versailles et de Marly* from 1701, 1707, and 1717 [^4]; and the *Inventaire des tableaux du Roy* compiled by Nicolas Bailly from 1709 and 1710[^5]. Additionally, I benefitted from Mathieu Lett's study in which he first commenced the data systematisation of the collection in the *petit appartement*[^6].

{% endfigure %}

The written sources allowed the identification of 931 paintings present in Versailles from the palace's establishment as one of the locations of the *Cabinet des Tableaux* in 1671 until Louis XIV died in 1715[^7] **(Fig. 2)**. All the items have been individually assessed by a number of fields, aiming to unveil the individual intrinsic features and relate each element within the general collection's qualities. The data have been organized within a spreadsheet that contains the initial findings, and deploys the derived values, such as the paintings' area, the production date range ---if not already known--- and the iconographic description (**Fig. 3**).

{% endfigure %}

The resulting matrix bears, first, the sources where the items appear. This operation keeps an account of the consistency of the primary references, and it records the eventual discrepancies of location and timing among the different authors. Second, the section of the painting's authorial information reveals the contemporary and historical attributions, and thus sheds light on the taste and motivations expressed within Louis[']{dir="rtl"}s acquisitions, the artistic school's relevance, and, potentially, on the painting's spatial collocations and the significance of their movement. Third, the spatial location of the paintings ---although for some items the sources only give a generic location, i.e. Versailles--- permits to reconstruct the detailed geography of the positioning and movements of the paintings, especially for those gravitating to the king[']{dir="rtl"}s private apartments. Fourth, the date framing considers the multiple relations occurring between the author's biographical dates, the painting production (potentially deducted from the latter or indicated in primary or secondary sources) and the date of acquisition (also indicated in the primary sources or inferred from the relation between production date and accounting of possess). These data are enhanced by the information retrieved on the provenance of the paintings within the Crown's collections together with the status of the artwork and its location within the contemporary public domain. Last and most important, the manual attribution ---achieved analysing the painting or guessing from the source's description in the case of lost works--- of the Iconclass codification of all the 931 items.

This file underwent several reiterations, and it served as entry material for a first digital process conducted with Python. This programming language allowed the analysis between the number of paintings by author with the relative area. (**Fig. 4**) From this relationship what emerges is the overall more importance of the Italian school in terms of numbers and painting coverage. At the same time, some cases (Francesco Albani, Domenichino, and Guido Reni above all) show the discrepancy between the average number of items and the painted surface. This occurs due to the traditional smaller size of the works realized in Italy between the late fifteenth and early seventeenth century compared to the late seventeenth century French paintings. Far from being a mere technical specification, this remark must be taken in consideration to evaluate the influence of an iconography in relation to the painting's reach. A second set of data parsing has been conducted relating the iconographic qualities to the quantitative data, like the number of paintings and the painting coverage by author, or to the production and acquisition's dates.

{% endfigure %}

Iconclass aims to provide a coherent classification structure by pictorial subject, overcoming the lengthy and time-consuming description of the actual artworks[^8]. The Iconclass attribution spans the nine iconographic classes relevant for our period of interest[^9], and detects the main iconography within the first 450 sub-categories ranging from the sacral formulas like Angels, Saints, God Father, Virgin Mary, et al., to profane themes like the historical portraits, depiction of festivities, parties, hunting, sport activities, passion, love, etc. Further analysis of the artworks permits access to the contextual semantics of the specific scene, attributing one concept among the 2,5 million iconographies available.

Any iconographic concept is expressed within a chain that locates it according to the accuracy of the subject detected. For example, the Iconclass alphanumerical notation of Paolo Veronese's *Esther before Ahasuerus* (**Fig. 5**) displayed at the *Antichambre de l'* *Œil-de-Bœuf* would be expressed as follows:

{% figure caption: "Figure 5 TK." %}
!({{site.url}}/assets/img/v07/gigone/figure5.png)
{% endfigure %}

7 Bible

71 Old Testament

71Q the story of Esther

71Q6 Esther before Ahasuerus (Esther 5:1-4)

71Q63 Esther swoons on the shoulder of one of her maids (Esther
15:7)[^10].

The use of Iconclass allows the data collection of the *Cabinet des Tableaux* to exhibit the evidence of Louis' taste for a specific iconography in relation to the other data, like time, location within the residence ---whether public or private---, artistic school, size of the painting, or type of commission (acquisition or assignment).

### Paintings in context

Of the many possibilities offered by the cross-checking of the data, I focused on the evidence of Louis[']{dir="rtl"}s taste emerging from his conscious selection of paintings operated within his apartments.

The considered rooms are not just those that, traditionally, historiography identifies as the *private* part of the king[']{dir="rtl"}s abode, namely the *Petit Appartement*. On the contrary, due to the architectural transformations from Versailles[']{dir="rtl"}s inception to Louis[']{dir="rtl"}s departure ---or, at least, until 1701--- the rooms housing the painting collection went from the *Salle des Gardes* to the *Cabinet des Medailles*, which had an independent access from the *Grand Appartements*. Nonetheless, the earliest inventory dates from 1695[^11], which limits our inquiry to the last 20 years of Louis[']{dir="rtl"}s reign. 

The king[']{dir="rtl"}s apartments consisted of fourteen rooms forming a sequence that dictated the liturgical approach ---hence the proximity--- to Louis. This sequence had one main access (the queen[']{dir="rtl"}s staircase) and, according to the person[']{dir="rtl"}s rank and the reason for the visit, the approach would have ended at the *Salle des Gardes* or, in the best case, at the *Petite Galerie* **(Fig. 6)**. Depending on the penetration[']{dir="rtl"}s level into the king[']{dir="rtl"}s sequence, and the frequency of the visits, a certain type of arrangement of paintings ---a particular access to Louis[']{dir="rtl"}s taste*---* could therefore be detected. The daily attendees to the king[']{dir="rtl"}s *lever*, for example, would hardly miss any change in the display of the collection until the *Salle du Conseil*. However, the rooms they walked through were rarely subject to any transformation. On the contrary, an extraordinary guest --- a diplomat or a foreign prince--- would have had access to the deepest part of the apartment and would therefore have encountered the most intimate taste of the king. However, due to the exceptionality of the visit, unique guests could not observe changes or deliberate choices in the iconographic display ordained by the king.

{% endfigure %}

### Spatial references

The source for detecting the spatial distribution of the collection within the *Appartement du Roi* is the *Nouvelle description des chateaux et parcs de Versailles* by Jean-Aimar Piganiol de La Force in his three consecutive editions of 1701, 1707, and 1717 **(Fig. 7)**. If the latter is substantially like the one of 1707 ---however bearing some interesting additions--- the first two recorded the substantial apartment[']{dir="rtl"}s transformation of 1701. It seems plausible that Piganiol visited the royal residences some years before publishing the guide. In the 1701 edition the sequence started at the S*alle des Gardes* and continues with the *Antichambre du Roy*, the *Chambre du Roy* (previously the *Chambre de la Reyne*), the *Grand Salon*, and the *Salle du Conseil*, before introducing the most secluded sequence of rooms. The 1707 and 1717 editions registered the creation of the *Œil-de-Bœuf *(called *Grand Sallon*) as the new *Chambre du Roi[']{dir="rtl"}s *antechamber (that took the central position of the previous *Grand Sallon*), followed by the enlarged *Salle du Conseil*. The following rooms ---if not for the nomenclature--- did not change in Piganiol[']{dir="rtl"}s description. The sequence is formed by the *Cabinet du Billard*, the *Vestibule du Petit Escalier*, the *Deuxième Antichambre du Cabinet des Tableaux*, the *Cabinet des Tableaux*, the *Cabinet des Coquilles*, the *Sallon de la Petite Gallerie*, the *Petite Galerie.* The *Cabinet Des Medailles*, due to its unique entrance from the *Salle de l[']{dir="rtl"}Abondance,* is described within the *Grand Appartements*. Significantly, Piganiol, contrary to Félibien in his *Tableaux du Cabinet du Roy*, proceeded his literary journey by describing the the king's residence as a sequence ofrooms ---that had already reached their architectural completeness--- characterising these only by the displayed paintings' []{dir="rtl"}features. The author was conscious of the artistic and socio-political implications embedded in the arrangement of the *Appartement du Roi*, especially after the transformation of 1701. However, the whole and conspicuous symbology attached to the Sun king[']{dir="rtl"}s liturgical approach was condensed into an accurate unfolding on the walls of the series of mobile objects and the sorting of a calibrated balance among the iconographies available.

### An iconographic reading

Proceeding in the analysis of the king[']{dir="rtl"}s painting collection ---intended as a unitary source--- from its intrinsic pictorial value, namely the iconography, and from its unavoidable relation to architecture ---thus forming the *Cabinet des Tableaux*---the collected data offer a valuable perspective.

The first evidence is quantitative. The 931 paintings[^12] forming the collection located in Versailles covered an area of 1576 m^2^, equal to a square with a side of almost forty meters. The numbers do not look impressive, even if compared to contemporary European collections. However, these quantities must be considered for the enormous possibilities that the combination of the paintings would have offered, and for the few ---hence, driven by a specific taste--- that have been realized.

The most frequent general iconographies found in Versailles were Biblical (Ic. 2: 204 paintings, 21,9% of the total), Classical Mythology[^13] (Ic. 9: 192 paintings, 20,6%) and Society, Civilisation, Culture (Ic. 4: 189 paintings, 20,3%). The collection also covered the categories of Nature (Ic. 2: 21, 13%), and Religion and Magic (Ic. 1: 114, 12,2%). The first three iconographies shared a similar ratio in terms of covered surface: 25,3%, 24,2%, and 19,2% respectively, for a total of 68,7% of the total paintings[']{dir="rtl"} area within the *château* **(Fig. 8)**. 

{% figure caption: "Figure 8 TK." %}
!({{site.url}}/assets/img/v07/gigone/figure8.png)
{% endfigure %}

Despite the apparent similarity of these three iconographic categories in terms of material presence, the most interesting quality for all the classes stands in their paintings production timeframe ratio. If the Mythological iconography shares an equal number of paintings produced before and after Louis became king in 1654 (97 versus 95), the other classes ---exception made for Abstract Ideas and Concepts that, counting only five items, makes the statistic irrelevant--- are unbalanced towards one or the other period **(Fig. 9)**. 

{% figure caption: "Figure 9 TK." %}
!({{site.url}}/assets/img/v07/gigone/figure9.png)
{% endfigure %}

Clearly, the elevation of 1654 as the year of clear separation does not add any argument per se about the assessment of the individual paintings, that would require a specific historical study. However, it can offer a good sense of the iconographic preferences and Louis's personal influence on creating his collection. More interesting is to argue whether the second Jabach sale in 1671 can stand as a clear demarcation in the paintings' production in relation to ---thought, historically, not only--- the presence of the Sun King on the market[^14]. It emerges that Biblical iconography was acquired through works mainly produced in a previous time (182 versus 22). The bulk of the Biblical iconography was produced by Italian artists (140 paintings), completed by 27 paintings by French artists and 15 by German and Flemish painters. At the same time, Society, Civilisation, Culture was a much more contemporary artistic interest, counting 78 works already on the market, versus 110 produced while Louis XIV was expanding his collection[^15] **(Fig. 10)**. There is a correlation between the king's iconographic interest in works categorized under Iconclass 4 and the contemporary artistic offer. This analysis, taking into account the authorial origin of the works, shows how the

{% figure caption: "Figure 10 TK." %}
!({{site.url}}/assets/img/v07/gigone/figure10.png)
{% endfigure %}

Sun King ---as an artistic--- patron favoured the French school representatives[^16]. This evidence foregrounds the Italian hegemony on the painting until the middle seventeenth century and, at the same time, the loss of interest in such iconography within the French king's court.

Similarly, examining the Mythological iconography, a shift occurred between 1654 and 1671. While there is a parity before the coronation (97% of Iconclass 9 produced before 1654 versus 95% afterward), the second Jabach sale represented the achievement of the French cultural supremacy that benefitted from the mythological formulas imported from Italy.

Considering the paintings produced before 1671, the collection listed 49 items produced by 23 French painters; on the Italian side, there were 53 works by 22 artists. After 1671, the French school added 77 more (from 20 painters) versus only one artwork coming from the Italian Peninsula. This discrepancy occurred because, in 1671, the effects of Colbert[']{dir="rtl"}s co-opting of the *Académie* for the promotion of the French artists caused the almost complete replacement of the private commissions, thus determining a long-lasting influence on the iconography.

The balance attained before 1671 was achieved mainly through the strong presence of two artists that, differently, encountered the taste of the king: Francesco Albani and Nicolas Poussin.

### The *Appartement du Roi*

Taking a closer look at the *Appartement du Roi* in Versailles it becomes clear that Louis' taste aligns with European tendencies. The 218 paintings present in his apartment were produced by an array of 73 artists: 42 Italians, 13 French, 7 Anonymous, 6 Flemish, 2 Germans, 2 Walloons, and 2 Dutch. The apparent supremacy of the Italian school was, nonetheless, levelled by the proportion in surface coverage. While considering the absolute numbers, Italians were the 57% of the total compared to the 18% of Frenchmen, the area covered saw a gap between them of only 12% (54% versus 42%) (**Fig. 11**).

{% figure caption: "Figure 11 TK." %}
!({{site.url}}/assets/img/v07/gigone/figure11.png)
{% endfigure %}

Moreover, looking at the general tendencies, the only countries ---related to the French artistic context--- increasing the engagement of the painters with the market were the Habsburg and Germanic area. While the Germans painters[^17] occupied a limited position in terms of number or physical appearance, the French school's rising position in the European context was the effect of the Bourbon's artistic promotion commenced under Louis XIII (and supported by cardinal Richelieu). The emblematic missions of Paul Fréart de Chantelou in Italy (1640 and 1643) meant to discover and import Italian masterpieces to the French homeland (and to bring home painters like Nicolas Poussin) were just the tip of the iceberg of the cultural struggle which, soon, would see the French culture prevailing.

The Dutch school saw a dramatic fall in numbers from the emergence of Louis XIV's influence. The *Cabinet des Tableaux* in Versailles recorded a Dutch and Walloon presence with a total of only eight paintings, covering barely 2,3% of the total surface. Moreover, examining the bold Italian presence, it appears that among the 42 Italian painters, only four were contemporaries of Louis XIV: Guercino (1591-1666), Pier Francesco Mola (1612-1666), Carlo Maratta (1625-1713), and Giovanni Andrea Sirani (1610-1670). Exception made for Guercino, they were not even among the most renowned artists of the Peninsula. Linking this common consideration to the evident decrease of the Italian representatives, it appears that Louis's notorious attention for Italian art, often mentioned in historiography, was directed towards a pure collecting of pieces from the past. Conversely, the French counterpart ---counting 13 painters--- included ten of the king's contemporaries. This was the sign that Louis surrounded himself with the emergent or established living national artists, whose career was boosted by the establishment of the *Académie*. This evidence also emerged from the overlap of the work production timeframe referred to the complete collection of 931 artworks present in Versailles.

How should we then describe Louis XIV's taste and iconographic preferences whilst exploring the *Cabinet des* *Tableaux*  through the tight linkage to the most secluded spaces of the *Appartement du Roi*? Considering only the 218 paintings (23% of the total) detected from the above-mentioned sources displayed from the *Salle des Gardes* to the *Cabinet des Medailles*, the iconography balance among the 9 Iconclass categories is very different from the entire corpus of paintings **(Fig. 12)**. While in the entirety of Versailles, Ic. 4, 7, and 9 coexist in a similar material and numerical presence, Louis XIV prioritized Biblical iconography for his most secluded rooms, representing between 45 and 51% of the selected collection. The reasons are, as often happens, not attributable to a univocal fact or cause. The strong presence of paintings of the sixteenth and early seventeenth century on the market at the time of the king's acquisitions could explain the prevalence of Religious, and specifically, Biblical iconography. Looking at the *morceau de réception* required as acceptance at the *Académie* in its early times, the landscapes, still life, and the mythological scenes did not completely replace the traditional formulas[^18]. Yet, the predominance of Italian artists (148 Italians versus 57 French) from a previous epoch in relation to Louis's collection is clear; within this research path, it does not define a cause, but it is part of the inquiry itself.

### Conclusions

In conclusion, the ongoing study's main goal was to determine the emergence of the taste in Louis XIV's adoption of a specific iconography as evidence of the privacy's inception within the *Appartement du Roi* in Versailles.

The paper has shown a correlation between the architecture of the *Appartement du Roi* and the corresponding section of the *Cabinet des Tableaux*: moreover, the two formed an indissoluble entity that established the conditions for the development of the royal taste. The digital approach offered a critical methodology to define and quantify the object of the realm of taste for a painting collection. By assessing a significant number of data points that, in their entirety, ascertain the value of a broader perspective of investigation without neglecting the closer analysis.

    Colbert. The acquisition lots are: Francis I's *ancien fond*; the
    paintings donated to Louis XIII by the cardinal Richelieu; the first
    part of Eberhard Jabach's collection (before 1666); a small part of
    the cardinal Mazarin's collection; the donation of cardinal Flavio
    Chigi (1664); the collection of the Duc the Richelieu (1665); the
    donation of the Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili (1665); the first
    Jabach sale (1666); eight paintings from Hoursel (1670); the second
    Jabach sale (1671); the Fouquet sequestration (1671); the
    acquisition of the collection of the mysterious La Feuille (1671);
    52 paintings stocked at the Gobelins; the acquisitions from the
    merchant Alvarez (1681-1683); finally, other 56 paintings purchased

    the collection ---here extremely simplified--- is contained in Le
    Brun's *Inventoire* is published in Brejon de Lavergnée, Arnauld.
    *L[']{dir="rtl"}inventaire Le Brun de 1683: la collection des
    tableaux de Louis XIV*. Paris: RMN, 1987. Despite Brejon de
    Lavargnée declares that: "*L\'étude de la collection des peintures
    du banquier allemand Eberhard Jabach ---deux cent une pièces,
    \[...\]--- a toujours été difficile à ent reprendre, car
    l\'historien ne possède ni les inventaires de ses deux premières
    collections, ni la liste officielle des tableaux qui furent acquis
    par le Roi*", this lot, however, clearly marks ---for its
    chronology, modality, and consistency--- the shift from a natural
    acquisition due to Louis's royal prerogatives, and the king's direct
    agency on the art market.
