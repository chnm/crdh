abstract: |
  While public awareness of incorporated black historic towns and urban neighborhoods in places like Rosewood, Florida, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Eatonville, Florida grow, less is known about unincorporated Black settlements in Texas. From 1865 to 1920, African Americans founded at least 557 self-sustaining freedom colonies in Texas. The authors engage the history of Black placemaking through the lens of Texas freedom colonies in Newton and Jasper Counties, areas better known for racial violence than liberation. The paper argues that biases in public history and historic preservation policy toward white settlerism, building integrity, and property ownership inhibit the documentation, recognition, and, consequently, the preservation of freedom colonies and their origin stories, necessitating creative approaches to mapping and arguing for these communities' "historic significance" and protection. Authors mapped freedom colonies through collection and analysis of both publically available data and intangible heritage, specifically sonic and social histories in Newton and Jasper County during a pilot study. This initial mapping exercise gave birth to the statewide crowdsourcing and mapping project, The Texas Freedom Colonies Atlas. Housed on multiple digital humanities platforms, the Atlas contains a map of 357 settlements and translates local constructions of historical significance to policymakers and cultural resource managers.

Heritage is spatial because it asks us to consider where something
occurred and why it happened there. Historical designation policies are
based on officially accepted theories of historical significance, social
location, and collective identities. Regulatory frameworks,
architectural and archaeological expertise, and social assumptions about
which places matter inform decisions about which sites are designated as
"historical" and worthy of specific land use protections. Official
processes, documentation and designation can create homogenized
histories that remove differences, conflicts, and complexities.[^1] For
example, Texas freedom colony settlement formation and dispersal are
consequences of multiple spatialized heritages rooted in slavery,
emancipation, and resistance against racial terrorism and Jim Crow laws.
Thus heritage and public history, especially that informed by racialized
regulatory regimes, become powerful mediums through which the
significance of identity and place are mediated. This study of freedom
colonies (FCs) and the subsequent development of an online Atlas based
on its findings is one approach to reclaim histories of Black agency in
the landscape from official heritage mediators who control what
Laurajane Smith calls Authorized Heritage Discourse.[^2]

Freedom colonies are historic African American settlements founded after
the Civil War in Texas. From 1865 to 1920, African Americans founded at
least 557 self-sustaining FCs (also known as Black settlements and
Freedmen's Towns) in Texas. Freedom colonies notably reflect a trend in
precipitous increases in Black land ownership during Reconstruction and
Progressive Eras. For instance, Black Texans went from owning 1.8% of
Texas farmland in 1870 (839) to 26% (12,513) in 1890.[^3] By 1900,
African Americans represented 31% of rural landowners in Texas.[^4]
Freedom colonies are where these clusters of landowners lived.

These rural Texas landscapes, historically associated with exclusion and
even hate crimes,[^5] are simultaneously under-recognized and
unprotected sites holding evidence of Black freedom seeking articulated
through placemaking. For example, Huff Creek, in Jasper County, (depicted in Figure 1) was a
little known freedom colony. The 1998 dragging death of James Byrd,
which took place on the community's main road, overshadowed the
existence of the freedom colony in the public imagination. Instead, popular culture considers the City of Jasper the site of the crime rather than unincorporated Huff Creek. FCs are also
particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, absent from public
planning records, and lack access to the funding and technical
assistance afforded incorporated, urbanized, mapped places.

{% figure caption: "Figure 1. The left image shows Huff Creek Chapel, which was once a school. It is the last remaining anchor site of the Huff Creek Community, a freedom colony.

{% endfigure %}

Archaeologists, cultural resource management professionals,
architectural historians, and even government agencies are endeavoring
to bring attention to the FCs around the country. I situate FC
preservation among similar efforts to protect and interpret southern
African American places and placemaking. Grassroots organizations like
the Historic Black Towns and Settlements Association advocate for
funding and support for incorporated Black towns (three of which are shown in Figure 2) including Tuskegee, Alabama, Mound Bayou, Mississippi, and Rosewood and Eatonville, Florida,
and western All-Black Towns in Oklahoma and Kansas.[^6]
These towns still have substantial populations, are mapped, and often
have politically sophisticated leaders. By contrast, FCs were often
never officially incorporated, have small populations, and no official
representation concerning land use issues decided in Texas on the city
level. Historically, a Texas FC was "'individually unified only by
church and school and residents' collective belief that a community
existed."[^7] A lack of documentation and compliance with sociolegal
constructions of place, unfortunately, caused several FCs to disappear
from public records, maps, and memory as their populations, historic
buildings, and visibility declined after World War II. Further, a lack
of estate planning made their landowners vulnerable to land loss.
Sprawl, climate change, and gentrification have endangered what
buildings remain.

{% figure caption: "Figure 2. Freedom colonies can be situated within the Reconstruction Era Black Towns and Settlements movement. Well-known settlements are Rosewood, FL, Nicodemus, KS, and Eatonville, FL. In contrast to these towns, most freedom colonies were rarely their own independent, incorporated towns." %}

{% endfigure %}

Furthermore, FCs were often founded in bottomland in low-lying
areas.[^8] The legacy of these geographical vulnerabilities is
highlighted by the FEMA - Hurricane Harvey Impact layer of the Texas
Freedom Colony Atlas, (seen in figure 3) which shows that 229 FCs are in fifty-three FEMA
designated counties, constituting 41% of total FCs or 64 % of the 357
mapped FCs. Further, the prevalence of unclear titles among landowners
and lack of historical integrity of properties in FCs make them
ineligible for FEMA, SBA, and HUD recovery funds [^9] and even less
likely to be considered endangered by public preservation agencies.

{% figure caption: "Figure 3. The FEMA - Hurricane Harvey Impact layer of the Texas Freedom Colony Atlas showedthat 229 FCs are in 53 FEMA designated counties, constituting 41% of total FCs or 64 % of the 357 mapped FCs. The map, generated from the Atlas data, indicates the vulnerability of remaining
historic sites in freedom colonies." %}
![This map from the Texas Freedom Colony Atlas shows the counties, predominantly in the eastern part of the state, which suffered the greatest impact of Hurricane Harvey.](/assets/img/v02/roberts/figure3.jpg){% endfigure %}

All of these environmental and political vulnerabilities compromise FC
buildings and structures. As a result, while primary and secondary
sources necessary to form a strong basis for historical argumentation
may be available for FCs, that evidence is subordinate to historic
preservation's regulatory requirement of materiality or integrity. FC's
built environments, especially when geographically and historically
situated in vulnerable areas lacking government investment, require
different forms of evidence of place to enable interpretation, and
recognition of their freedom-seeking heritage. This article argues that
social and "sonic"[^10] histories offer evidence of historically
significant Black landscapes, rendered ungeographic[^11] by historic
preservation's authorized heritage discourse and environmental
vulnerability.

### Significance and Integrity: National Historic Preservation Regulations 

To understand how historic preservation determines what makes a place
historic and thus worth recognizing or in some cases providing certain
protections, I will focus on two aspects of the federal regulations:
historical significance and integrity. These criteria are important to
planners and policymakers because they determine why a building or place
is worth preserving or designating "historic." [^12]

The criteria are based on the "quality of *significance* in American
history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present
in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
*integrity* of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association." More specifically, these properties must be
sites, people, or architectural examples that are significant to history
or prehistory. [^13] The significance of historic sites or properties is
determined using the National Register's Criteria for Evaluation.
Dimensions of significance are the architectural and historic value of
the property, its age, whether a notable resident lived in the house,
evidence of a distinct settlement pattern in a potential district, or
architectural style. A site need only reflect one dimension of
significance but could be deemed ineligible based on its lack of
integrity. The integrity of a site refers to the degree to which it is
physically intact and in a location or context relevant to the period of
historic significance. The National Register criteria guide
determinations of what is worthy of protection from demolition and what
qualifies for federal tax benefits.[^14] State level markers are
available to properties in Texas that are at least 50 fifty years old,
and are historically or architecturally significant, whereas subject
markers can recognize individuals, events, communities, and
institutions.[^15]

While the criteria serve as a valuable guide, they require a high level
of expertise (usually requiring applicants to hire architects or
archaeologists) to survey and document to federal specifications.
Specifically, the emphasis on the built environment and architecture has
privileged the material over the intangible culture making it difficult
for freedom colonies (FCs) to be listed. All designations, protections,
and incentives are based on a regulatory framework that emphasizes
strict adherence to regulations that facilitate erasure.

### Un-authorized Heritage: Newton and Jasper County Freedom Colonies and Black Pockets

At the pre-study stage of my research in Deep East Texas, I identified
only 14 freedom colony settlements. I have identified twenty-four more
place names associated with FCs and their anchor sites in Newton and
Jasper Counties. A map (shown in figure 4) generated after a two-year archival and
ethnographic study revealed the existence of places unmapped or absent
from lists of historic sites recognized by the state or federal
government, indicating a disparity between the number of freedom
colonies, which once existed, and the markers recognizing them.
A 2015 review of Texas State Historical Markers on the
state online atlas revealed sixty-one properties and sites recognized
through the program. Of those places or sites listed, a majority are
classified as graveyards or cemeteries (twenty-one), followed by
churches or religious sites (ten), and cities and towns (seven). In
Newton County, three of those "towns" are the Biloxi, Cedar Grove, and
Shankleville FCs. The other markers recognize an African American church
and one of the founders of Shankleville, Stephen McBride. Compared to
Newton County, Jasper County has six state historical markers
recognizing African American affiliated sites, none of which are FCs.
Between the two counties, there are eleven sites on the National
Register of Historic Places, but the Addie and AT Odom Homestead in
Shankleville is the only African American site listed. The FCs clusters
without markers were areas bifurcated by roads or abandoned after the
once dominate corporate mills left Newton County.

{% figure caption: "Figure 4. This map is the result of a 2-year study of freedom colony heritage and grassroots planning in Newton and Jasper counties. After creating a baseline list from publicly available data, ethnographic research revealed the existence of places either unmapped or absent from lists of historic sites recognized by the state or federal government. The disparity between the number
of freedom colonies, which once existed, and the markers recognizing them are stark. Of those
mapped above, only three markers exist which are standalone tributes to freedom colonies." %}

### Critiques of the Significance and Integrity Framework

Theorists contest the "expert" domination of preservation that informs
the regulatory framework. Randall Mason maintains that the physical
fabric and expertise have been overemphasized at the expense of the
"memory/fabric connection," a broad term that includes landscapes and
material culture at all scales in the environment.[^16] The integrity of
the built environment is not always what engenders support and action
among descendants, but rather the cultural continuity reflected in the
videos of homecoming celebrations. For many people, creating and
preserving spaces where people can practice values associated with their
culture and gather in their settlements is the priority.

An urban planning history and ethnographic study of freedom colony
vulnerabilities and grassroots preservation gave birth to the Atlas. The
map emerges from a study conducted 2014--2016 during which the author
collected archival materials; audiovisual files of forty-eight
interviews and homecoming events, cemetery tours, and meetings; field
notes; and US Geological Survey Spatial Data (GSSD) of FCs located in
Newton and Jasper Texas counties. The study heavily relied upon
intangible heritage because for some FCs, the assemblage of "citizens"
attending annual events is all the evidence that a place existed.

Observations of annual, commemorative gatherings such as family reunions
and community homecoming indicated that these events helped sustain the
diaspora's attachments to FCs. These events are a historical artifact of
the Great Migration, as they were founded to ensure those who left rural
Texas for big cities would return home. Homecoming presidents from
Jasper and Newton County freedom colonies (shown in figure 4) act as a cooperative network,
which gather annually at each other's two-day gatherings. The events
celebrate not only the heritage of the community, but the offering of
funds collected for the maintenance of each settlement's cemetery.
Artifacts of these events are sonic and ephemeral and
include paper programs (such as the one pictured in figure 6), which provide social histories of FCs. Programs distributed to guests list visiting choirs and congregations from
settlements whose names no longer appear on maps or anywhere else in the
public record. Freedom colonies are often only recognized
and remembered during the two-day events in which music and memories
about settlements are shared among descendants, extended family, and
church families. Witnessing and curating evidence of the social history
makes visible the historically significant sites overlooked by
preservationists due to regulatory standards, which downplay the
importance of intangible heritage. Several properties and places located
in the study area are historically significant and meaningful to
descendants yet not designated historic or protected sites.

{% figure caption: "Figure 5. Homecoming presidents from Jasper and Newton County settlements are pictured at Shankeville’s 2014 Annual Homecoming. Each represents a different freedom colony, which is part of their homecoming network. Each leader not only plans an individual event but also invites each
settlement to attend their respective event. At each event, an offering is collected which funds each
settlement’s cemetery maintenance for the year." %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 6. The Pleasant Hill Homecoming Celebration program (2015) lists guest churches and communities associated with communities not otherwise designated as significant or historic. Freedom colonies are often only recognized and remembered during the two-day events in
which music and memories about settlements are shared among decedents, extended family, and church family." %}

The research process solidifies the argument that embracing creative and
performative assemblage, orality, and memory was required to map the
balance of the unknown FCs. This initial mapping exercise gave birth to
the statewide mapping project. The current digital humanities platforms
holding data---a [Blogger.com website]<http://www.thetexasfreedomcoloniesproject.com/> and [ArcGIS Survey]<https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=48f89e0f870c4400a990682a09cf919f>---enable
educators, researchers, and descendant communities to demonstrate across
disciplines and outside academia, the historical significance of FC, and
facilitate re-envisioning citizen participation, mapping, and
preservation planning.[^17] In addition to the map (shown in figure 7), the website in which
it is embedded collects resident memories, photos, and calendar. Now,
357 of 557 FCs have been mapped, with 322 FC located using publicly
available data.

{% figure caption: "Figure 7. The [Texas Freedom Colony Atlas]<https://tamu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=48f89e0f870c4400a990682a09cf919f> and Survey allows for spatialization of varied forms of place data alongside the authorized heritage data which helps substantiate the existence of a historically significant place. The interactive atlas’ allows for uploading of stories, documents, photos, and memories of place along with calendars of events associated with the freedom colony. All visitors are invited to add to a separate layer, “new” or unknown freedom colonies." %}
![Screenshot of the Texas Freedom Colony Atlas, showing a map of Texas, with blue dots that represent the locations of identified freedom colonies](/assets/img/v02/roberts/figure4.jpg){% endfigure %}

Historic preservation standards around what defines place and historical
significance obscure the disappearing heritage of FCs, particularly in
those settlements with low populations and little remaining built
environment. Preservation policy, as a result, has a disparate impact on
the survival of many FCs that might otherwise thrive and benefit from
federal protections and tax breaks if the property-based bias were
eliminated. Recording commemorative events at buildings and spaces with
compromised integrity but embodied and performed constructions of a
community might substantiate significance. However, the evidence,
embedded in memory and orality, are distributed broadly across various
archives, commemorative practices, and declining structures. The goal of
the Atlas and its accompanying survey of descendants is to aggregate
layers of authorized evidence and crowdsourced data to empower residents
and to visualize the hidden histories, social vulnerabilities, and
current grassroots preservation activities for historians, policymakers,
and preservationists.
