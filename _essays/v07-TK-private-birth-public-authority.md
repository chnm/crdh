abstract: | "The article looks closely at discourses in a corpus of 16th and 18th century books on German midwifery. The historiography is well explained, particularly for a historian who may not be familiar with the exactly conversations in this area of history. The goal of topic modelings is to “explor[e] Wiesner’s notion that developments in the public/private divide are crucial to understanding the professionalization of midwifery and the establishment of obstetrics”. Right now, the article focuses more on the challenges of OCR to text analysis; this is a well traversed area in DH.  Rather, the article would benefit from showing how topic modeling begins to support, expand, complicate, and/or challenge Wiesner’s argument. It seems in the topic analysis section that there are ways that topic modeling supports and expands on Wisner’s  argument. By making those more explicit, the reader will be able to understand how topic modeling expands our understanding of the discourses/themes/topics related to midwifery.   Then, the conclusion could focus on the limits of the analysis and next steps."

Discourses on midwifery changed gradually but also significantly from
the sixteenth to the eighteenth century across Europe. In German-speaking territories, texts in the vernacular managed to reach a whole new audience, creating an adjacent market to the Latin learned instructions on pregnancy and childbirth at the turn of the sixteenth century. Manuals for midwives and instructions to pregnant women spread much wider as printing became more accessible, making the turn to the sixteenth century a heyday of influential midwifery manuals.[^1] As this knowledge circulated broadly, organizing and regulating the practice of midwifery became an increasing concern for the authorities. In response, many German cities began to issue ordinances for the local midwives.[^2] The seventeenth century witnessed the reprint of many of these manuals, as well as the translations of popular guides from different European regions.[^3] In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, faculties of medicine embraced the duty of examining midwives at an official level. That meant that new instructional texts were issued, and ordinances in many cases included the need for licenses by medical authorities in order for a midwife to be able to practice.[^4] In her study of southern Germany, Merry E. Wiesner has pointed out that such a shift seems to be connected to the growing public/private split and a consistent "privatization" of women.[^5] This "privatization" meant that the early modern period saw an increase push for women to be relegated to the domestic realm, with a more explicit association of the male as public and the female as private. However, she concludes that midwifery is a point of tension in such discourse. Female midwives worked as a bridge in the public/private distinction: they operated in intimate contact with the pregnant women while having a significant public role. When most women had their responsibilities attached to their households, midwives could even hold office in the principalities. However, the eighteenth-century growth in male midwives broke the female-dominant knowledge domain and demanded closer supervision of their practices, in a way removing their access to public authority. This notion of "privatization" of women and female midwives' exclusion from their position of authority as a process from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century helps us understand how birth went from a social moment with an intimate bond between the birthing person and the practitioner assisting to a more private and medicalized procedure.

Developments in the literature on midwifery directly impacted medical discourse and the creation of the field of obstetrics. Tracing the legal, medical, and economic influences in this literature through this *longue-durée* history -- from the early vernacular publications to the efforts of officializing and medicalizing the profession -- can help us understand the circulation of knowledge on pregnancy and childbirth. Distant reading can be a great help in such an endeavor. [Applying topic modeling tools to explore the different topic trends in midwifery publications can provide an important overview of the shifts in perceptions surrounding midwives' practices and knowledge. My aim is to create a control group to examine the benefits and pitfalls of such an approach.]{.mark} I will select some key midwifery publications of the sixteenth and eighteenth century that are machine-readable and available online and run them through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model provided by the tool MALLET. I will separate this corpus into different assessment groups and compare the results delivered with a human examination of the sources. The results presented here can inform future research questions that can involve much larger corpora and help us trace the movement of early modern midwifery in the private/public spectrum in a *long-durée* perspective.

### Establishing a control corpus and topic modeling

The idea of the corpus used here is to have selected relevant publications of midwife manuals and ordinances from the sixteenth century and from the eighteenth century to observe how the topic modeling tool performs in terms of tracing the discourse trends of these two defining periods in midwifery literature in Germany. These texts were all collected from available online repositories that can be accessed via Google Books,[^6] as the optical character recognition results of these copies present the same patterns and issues when it comes to the German *Fraktur* typeface in which these texts were printed.[^7]

There are some field-defining texts when we speak of early modern German midwife manuals. The work of Eucharius Rößlin (c. 1470 -- 1526) is on this list. His *Der schwangeren Frauen und Hebammen Rosengarten* is considered the first comprehensive midwifery manual in the German vernacular, published in 1513 Strasbourg.[^8] This text was, hence, the starting point of forming the present corpus. But midwifery literature includes more than manuals -- there was spiritual guidance to be provided, and books of prayers for pregnant women were part of midwives' repertoire. These books provided spiritual guidance and religious explanations for the experiences of pain, illness, and death related to childbirth. Given the high mortality rate for pregnant women and infants, this particular kind of consolation literature was considered crucial for midwives to operate as healers of body and soul.[^9] Moreover, ordinances defined the contours of their practices' legality, most times being written with the help of official midwives. As such, they are a crucial source for understanding what was considered the *proper* practice of midwifery, what knowledge and techniques could be employed, and their responsibilities to their patients.

The literature on midwifery is, therefore, varied and composed in different styles. Ordinances were written following typical codes of regulations. Spiritual guidance books follow a more theological formulation. Manuals were composed to provide short yet precise descriptions of procedures, techniques, and potential effects on the patients' bodies, sometimes including illustrations. These variations in writing style can have an effect on the results of the topic modeling tools. As such, the corpora were created with these differences in mind. For the sixteenth-century corpus, eight books were included, of which two were spiritual guidance, two were ordinances, and four were manuals.[^10] The same was done for the eighteenth century -- the corpus was composed of eight books, of which two were spiritual guidance, two ordinances, and the remaining were manuals.[^11] The two corpora will be analyzed separately to contrast the topics that emerge in these two pivotal moments. These texts create a balanced sample, as their OCR is of the same standard, they are available open access for the reproduction of the study and encompass all the main kinds of printed sources for the study of midwifery. As an initial group, they will allow us to see what main hurdles future studies might face when incorporating big data for historical sources that include German *Fraktur* texts.

To extract topics from this corpus, I used the MALLET toolkit. The initial attempts made clear that these historical German texts required a custom stopword list. MALLET has standard lists of stopwords is in English, German, Finnish, French, and Japanese, but the pre-made list in German does not account for common historical variations (such as *vnnd* instead of *und*).[^12] Some stopwords are also affected by OCR problems with the historical German spelling (for instance, *uns* can be spelled as *unß,* and the OCR can read it as *unl3* or similar). Moreover, common OCR misidentifications had to be taken into account (for instance, for the stopword *solche*, it was crucial to add also *ſolche*, and folche, as well as the conjugated versions like *solchen* or *solches*, for example, in all of the variations of potential OCR misrecognition). This also required particular care not to remove potential useful words. Using the example above of the 's' being recognized as 'f', for the stopword *sein* (to be, or his, or \[we\] are) it was needed to add *ſein* and *ſeyn,* but *fein* is its own word (fine, subtle, or delicate). We need to be aware, then, if the topic *fein* appears, it might just be a misidentified *sein*. Taking these issues into account, I ran a few experiments on topic modeling this midwifery literature.

### Sixteenth-century topics
{% figure caption: "Figure 1." %}

{% endfigure %}

The topics of the sixteenth-century corpus reveal patterns of problems with the OCR. The letter 'z' is consistently substituted by the letter g', as in the words for remedy *(Arznei*) appears as *argney*, and root (*Wurzel*) shows up as *wurgel*. Some of the topics are also beginnings or endings of words that have been separated in the pages of the book (like *ges* or *nen*). As such, depending on the corpus and the goal of a particular study, such separated endings could be added to a custom stopword list.

Most of the topics are expected terms relating to midwifery, such as woman/women (*fraw/frawe/frawen*), female (*weib/weibern*), child (*kind/kindlein*), mother (*mutter*), pregnancy (*schwanger*), and birth (*geburt/geboren*). *Rosengarten* is another prominent topic. Although that attests to the popularity of Rößlin's book, one of the reasons is that *Ehestandts Artzeney* also includes a copy of the *Rosengarten*. On top of that, most manuals reference this work, and it became basically a marketing strategy to include the term *Rosengarten* as a part of midwifery texts.

Body (*leib*), uterus *(bärmütter* -- appearing as *beermåtter*), navel *(nabel*), eyes (*augen*), back (*rucken*) and adjectives like moist (*feucht*), heavy *(schwer*) and warm (*warm*), and pain *(schmerzen --* appearing as *ſchmergen)* indicate key physical aspects in the texts. The topics also highlight medicines such as powders (*pulver*), plasters (*pflaster*), substances like chamomille (*camillen*), leafs (*bletter*), lilies (*lillien*), honey (*honig*), and liquids like water (*wasser*) and milk *(milch*), which occur in the texts as recipe ingredients, but also referring to mother's milk and amniotic fluid. An intriguing topic is the appearance of *gummi* -- which would normally be translated as rubber. While rubber originated from *Hevea brasiliensis* as we know it today was not a substance used in sixteenth-century German-speaking territories, by reading the sources, it is clear that the texts are referring to different natural latex, such as the ones derived from Asafoetida or *Ferula persica*, which were used as bonding agents for early modern pills.

Group 9 concentrated on religious topics, such as God (*gott/gottes*) and cross *(creuß*). As mentioned previously, these themes were common throughout midwifery literature, butas expected, the books on spiritual guidance are the ones containing most of these topics when looking at the text composition statistics.

Comfort seemed to be of particular concern, appearing twice as a topic *bequemer/bequemen*), signaling the care for the pregnant women's conditions. This might suggest personal attention and care between midwives and their clientele. This concern also seems to extend to the circumstances of the pregnancy, given the presence of marital status (*ehestandts*) among the identified topics. These could be seen as little glimpses of the public/private boundaries related to pregnancy and childbirth. However, as this is a control experiment, going back to a closer look at the original sources reveals that, although some of the texts address the role of marriage, the fact that the topic identified was *ehestandts* (conjugated in the genitive) indicates that it was selected due to the book *Ehestandts Artzeney*, which was formatted with the title as a header on every page, becoming a prominent topic for MALLET. This is an important point to keep in mind for larger corpora, as sources that include the title on the header of pages might skew the prominence of certain topics.

### Eighteenth-century topics
{% figure caption: "Figure 2." %}
!({{site.url}}/assets/img/v07/kafer/figure2.png)
{% endfigure %}
When it comes to the OCR, a few issues appear consistently. The letter 's' being substituted by the letter 'f', for instance, continues as a pattern, and the abovementioned potential of the word *fein* as a topic potentially being the stopword *sein* seems to be the case here. A few letters shifted according to the style of the *Fraktur* types -- for example, the 'h' in *Hebamme* being read as a 'd' (*debamme*). Having beginnings or endings of words as topics continues to be prominent.

There are a lot of parallels between the topics from the sixteenth-century and the eighteenth-century corpora. *Frau/frauen*, *kind/kinder*, *mutter*, *schwangern,* as expected, continue to feature as key topics. Birth (*geburt*) appears also with further specifications, such as time of birth (*geburtszeit*) and afterbirth(*nachgeburt*). We can notice the linguistic change of uterus from *Bärmütter* to *Gebärmütter*, as it is known in modern German.

Another important topic is urine (*urin*). This could indicate that uroscopy was a
{% figure caption: "Figure 3." %}
!({{site.url}}/assets/img/v07/kafer/figure3.png)
{% endfigure %}
relevant form of diagnosis in eighteenth-century midwifery. Uroscopy was already one of the main forms of diagnosis in formal medicine in the medieval period. Being an almost ubiquitous practice in the sixteenth century, examining a patient's urine seemed to have lost its appeal as a medical skill by the seventeenth century, as doctors sought novel forms of diagnosis.[^13] This appearance in eighteenth-century midwifery manuals might point out two potential developments. Although uroscopy might not have been a trend among doctors, it could have been seen as an important basic tool for midwives undergoing medical lessons to have under their belt. On the other hand, eighteenth-century technical developments renewed the interest in analyzing urine, bringing it again to the forefront of tools for diagnosis.[^14]

### Conclusion

Topic modeling can be a wonderful tool to explore discourse changes across time, as the project *Mining the Dispatch* has proved.[^15] A simple experiment with this control corpus from crucial periods for midwifery literature already indicates some subtle but significant shifts. Tools like MALLET can operate independently of the corpus' language, which lends itself perfectly to exploring Wiesner's notion that developments in the public/private divide are crucial to understanding the professionalization of midwifery and the establishment of obstetrics. Nevertheless, language still imposes challenges for a study with larger corpora.

OCR problems deriving particularly from German *Fraktur* sources are at the center of most of these issues. This experiment has already identified some useful patterns that are usually caught as topics --information that can be used to fix such issues on a larger scale. The consistency of misreading of certain letters can be used to refine future OCR scans. The particularities of German historical materials also require a customized list of stopwords. The list developed and used here will be available at GitHub to be used and expanded for future experimentation with German *Fraktur* sources.[^16] Moreover, page headings must be taken into account within the corpus, as they can skew results. Those are simple hurdles to overcome, and using topic modeling tools to follow patterns in discourse change in midwifery literature can be invaluable for understanding women's birthing practices and their professionalization, privatization, and even marginalization across the centuries.

[^13]: One of the main turns on the topics can be found in group 2. Grouped there are topics like class (*klasse*), which might indicate the increasing pressure for midwives to engage in anatomical lessons. Although *Klasse* has multiple meanings today, in this period, it is usually related to education. Teachers in its feminine form (*Lehrerinnen* -- appearing as *lehrnerinnen*) appear in the same group. This prominence of education terms could be influenced by the book *Hebammen-Schul Oder gründlicher Unterricht* ("Midwives' School or most thorough lesson") and its use of educational analogies.
