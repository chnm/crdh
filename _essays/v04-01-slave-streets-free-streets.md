If you could immerse yourself in a Google Map of Baltimore as it was two
hundred years ago, virtually strolling down the streets and wharves of
the early republic city, what would this visualization tell you about
the people of the past? [*Slave Streets. Free Streets: Visualizing the
Landscape of Early Baltimore*](https://earlybaltimore.org/ssfs)
is trying to answer these questions by highlighting the embedded
landscape in which approximately 4,300 enslaved and 10,300 free African
Americans lived and worked. Using the existing project *Visualizing
Early Baltimore* as a base, *Slave Streets, Free Streets* allows users
to see the way that slavery was enmeshed in the world of early
Baltimore (figure 1). It reminds us of the degree to which racial slavery and
nascent capitalism spun a web from which people struggled to extricate
themselves and their families. It allows us to put faces and names to
the largely anonymous ordinary people of the past. Finally, we are also
trying to make an argument about the power of visualization as a
story-telling medium, to show how mapping can spatially illuminate
relationships of power and place.

*Slave Streets, Free Streets* shows that for all of the ways that Early
Baltimore was full of the potential for freedom, it still was a city
dominated by racial slavery. Whites and blacks might have lived and
worked in close proximity to each other, in the same shipyards and in
the same neighborhoods, but they did not have the same opportunities for
advancement. The lives of Baltimore's free blacks, even those who
achieved some economic independence, were still shadowed by enslaved kin
and the ever-present trade in human beings.[^1]

Baltimore in the years after the War of 1812 was a bustling, thriving
port. It teemed with new immigrants from Europe and relocated country
folk. Enslaved people worked alongside free blacks and whites in the
city's shipyards and construction sites. Baltimore merchants shipped
more flour than their counterparts in any other American city, and the
city's wealth and banking interests helped to make it into a British
target during the War of 1812. Baltimoreans also had access to a wide
range of imported luxury goods---wines and sherries, olive oil and
coffee, silver and textiles (figure 2). But all of Baltimore's wealth could not
ensure adequate sanitation or housing for the thousands of indigent
people who filled its back alleys and wharves.

{% endfigure %}

Baltimore was unusual among cities of the time in that its population of
free blacks was twice that of the enslaved workers who toiled in the
city. This situation was a direct consequence of both Maryland's
location on the literal border between slavery and freedom and the
late-eighteenth century shift by many Maryland farmers from tobacco to
less labor-intensive cereal crops. As a result of this, Marylanders also
adopted the institution of "term slavery," where an enslaved person and
his or her owner would agree that after a certain term of years or at a
certain age, the enslaved person would be freed. This agreement was both
legally binding and transferable. As a result, many African Americans in
Baltimore lived in mixed families, with some members free and some
enslaved.[^2]

*Slave Streets, Free Streets* uses city directories, tax records,
newspapers, records of payrolls and licenses, and censuses to put
the mosaic pieces of ordinary lives together, giving life to the
disfranchised and dispossessed. We use a variety of stories to illuminate two main arguments. The first
is the power of visualization as a narrative medium. Our project
transforms a geographical map that depicts land features, built
structures, roadways, waterways, and ports to a thematic one,
illuminating social relationships and information. The cartographic
narratives help to make visible relationships of power and class,
showing the degree to which social and economic worlds were bounded or
fluid. The maps are *visualizations,* rather than simply
*illustrations*. That is, the argument or story is driven by the visual
aspects we highlight and interpret, rather than by only text (figure 3).[^3]

{% figure caption: "Figure 3. Fells Point in Baltimore. Green buildings are associated with free black residents; blue buildings housed enslaved workers; red buildings are associated with fugitive slaves; orange buildings are sites associated with the slave trade." %}

{% endfigure %}

Our other main interpretive argument involves documenting experiences on
the border of slavery and freedom. Slavery was inextricably woven
through the fabric of society in Baltimore, shaping the lives of blacks
and whites, free and enslaved. We spatially demonstrate this experience
in several ways. First, in dot-density maps we show that Baltimore's
1820 population (by ward) was relatively integrated, in vivid contrast
with the so-called "black butterfly" configuration of racial, social,
and economic segregation revealed in more recent maps of the city (figure 4; cf. figure 5).

{% figure caption: "Figure 4. Dot density map showing 1820 population by ward.  Each dot represents one person; they are randomly spaced within each ward's boundaries. In some cases ward boundaries were shrunken to incorporate only residential areas, not open land. The dots are randomly spaced within the wards, and their boundaries can be seen via the different densities." %}

To note that the Baltimore of two hundred years ago was less physically
segregated than the city is today is not to claim that it was an
equitable society. It was not; the peculiar institution was both
physically and spatially omnipresent, as a sampling of advertisements in
one newspaper, the *Baltimore American and Daily Advertiser* shows. We
looked at the first issue of each month for 1815 -- 1820, for a total of
64 issues (some months did not have extant editions). We found and
transcribed a total of 442 advertisements that dealt with slavery in
some form, and we sorted them into several categories as indicated in
the table below.[^5]

|     TOTAL                     |     442              |     145                                   |     35                    |     26                                   |     10          |     246                               |

We do not claim that these results are comprehensive; rather they are
suggestive. For our purposes, they are most useful for the information
about people and places that can be found within the text of the
advertisements. Over 90% of our samples mention a location of some sort:
the place where a fugitive might have run from or to, the home or
business of a seller, or the Baltimore Jail, which housed captured
fugitives. This allows users to see that in the absence of a single
slave market, the buying, selling, and hiring of enslaved workers was
happening all over the city, in newspaper offices and along the wharves,
in taverns and merchant shops. With the expansion of cotton cultivation
into the Gulf South after 1815, Baltimore became a center of the
domestic trade to the Deep South. This transition is visible through the
placement of ads seeking large numbers of enslaved workers to sell out
of state, as opposed to the more dominant local trade. However, many of
the participants in the local buying and selling of enslaved men, women,
and children are obscured by the very nature and language of the
advertisements. 156 ads for sale or hiring simply asked that interested
parties "enquire" at the *American Commercial and Daily Advertiser*
office, which was located at 4 Harrison Street. The *Advertiser*'s
staff presumably was not conducting the transactions, but rather
connecting buyers, sellers, and employers, leaving us with no records of
these interpersonal transactions.[^6]

Despite these limitations, the advertisements do provide us with a
wealth of information about black and white residents of early
Baltimore. The sample of 445 transcriptions includes mentions of over
150 African Americans, both (free and enslaved) and over 150 white
names. These names allow us to piece together networks of kinship and
neighborhood, and complement sources like city directories and tax
records. For example, hardware merchant James Biscoe placed the same
advertisement in the *Advertiser* for months in 1819-1820 (figure 6).

{% figure caption: "Figure 6. An advertisement placed for the fugitive Harry Moshier, _American Commercial and Daily Advertiser_, December 1, 1820." %}

{% endfigure %}

This brief document gives us a sense of the world in which Moshier lived
and worked as a blacksmith.[^8] His various owners or employers
(Biscoe's language is unclear) ran their businesses in Old Town at the
center of the city, often within a few blocks of each other. Biscoe, who
was Moshier's current owner, owned a hardware store on Market (or
Baltimore) street, the city's main commercial thoroughfare (figure 7). Dutton
Richards was a blacksmith with forges on Stillhouse Street, between Duke
and Granby. Richard Chenowith was described as a "patent ploughmaker,"
with his shop located appropriately on Ploughman Street, which ran
between the Falls and Granby street. Chenowith must have run a
substantial enterprise, since his 1820 census entry indicated that his
household included a total of 13 people engaged in manufacturing, a mix
of white, free black, and enslaved men, women, and children. Joseph T.
Ford was a cartwright, not to be confused with Joseph P. Ford, a
wheelwright; both Fords had addresses on or near Albemarle street. S.
Gill was most likely one of two Solomon Gills, both blacksmiths with
shops in Old Town.[^9]

{% figure caption: "Figure 7. Harry Moshier's neighborhood landscape. The Jones Falls is on the right, and the bridge crossing it is Baltimore Street." %}
![Harry Moshier's neighborhood landscape]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v04/rubin/figure7.png)
{% endfigure %}

But of course there is much we don't know. Was Moshier hired out to
these various shops? Or did he cycle through various owners? The former
seems more likely, since all of these white men moved in and out of
slaveownership, as was typical for Baltimore artisans. It's unclear who
actually owned Moshier. The 1818 tax records for Baltimore which listed
enslaved workers by name and age don't have a perfect match, although
suggestively Richard Chenowith did own a twenty-year-old Harry. He
can't be found directly in the census for 1820 or 1830. Given that he
might have been hiding in the city, we can assume he had a network of
friends or relatives. But we see him only through Biscoe's eyes.

A story that reveals more about free black networks and entrepreneurship
can be drawn from an advertisement that ran in the *American and
Commercial Daily Advertiser* in the summer of 1815 (seen on August 1,
1815 and September 1, 1815):

> Fifty Dollars Reward.
>
> Ranaway from the subscriber, on the 10^th^ inst. a negro man named
> Jim, but often called James Commodore, more usually Bill: 26 years of
> age, about 5 feet 1 or 2 inches high, thick and strong made, of a
> black complexion: he has a small scar on his forehead, has an old
> look, and talks very hoarse. Jim has a brother living in Baltimore,
> named Philip Hanson, a bright mulatto, who follows brick making, where
> he no doubt will be concealed. Whoever will apprehend said negro, and
> secure him in any jail in the state of Marykland, so that I get him
> again, or delivers him to me, the subscriber living adjoning
> Carroll's Manor, shall receive 25 doillars if taken in this state and
> if out of the state the above reward with all reasonable expences paid
> for.

{% figure caption: "Figure 8. Advertisement placed for James Commodore, _American and Commercial Daily Advertiser_, August 1, 1815" %}
![Advertisement placed for James Commodore]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v04/rubin/figure8.png)
{% endfigure %}

Baltimore newspapers frequently ran advertisements placed by slave
owners from all over Maryland and Virginia. That Andrew Anderson
believed Jim ran *to* Baltimore, in contrast to Harry Moshier running
*from* it, is not surprising; in fact, many of the advertisements placed
from other towns had Baltimore as the potential destination, because
enslaved people could hide among the large free population.[^10]

It is also not unusual that James Commodore had a free brother, named
Philip Hanson, in the city. Hanson was listed as one of just eight black
brickmakers in the 1819 Baltimore City Directory (there were over a
dozen whites in this occupation). Unusually, Hanson actually owned his
property, which was listed in 1818 City Tax records as a lot on the west
side of Scott Street, south of Washington Street in Ward 11, valued at
\$16, with an improved dwelling valued at \$40. Only one other black
brickmaker owned taxable property in 1818. In 1820, the census taker
listed Hanson as the head of an eleven-member household that included
four free black men over 25, and seven free black women ranging in age
from 14 to over 45.[^11] With this household size and relative wealth,
it is possible to speculate that James Commodore was harbored by his
brother. Or perhaps his brother helped Commodore to escape to freedom in
the North.

Phillip Hanson is just one example of a free black man who was able to
make a living and acquire property in early Baltimore. He lived in Ward
12, in the western part of the city.[^12] While the population of
whites, free blacks, and enslaved workers were relatively equally
distributed across Baltimore's twelve wards, the degree of integration
varied within individual wards and neighborhoods. Strawberry Alley, in
Fells Point, is a powerful example.

As the home to much of Baltimore's maritime industry, Fells Point was
lined with wharves and shipyards, its streets filled with artisans like
carpenters and caulkers, sail makers and riggers. According to city
directories and tax records, the Strawberry Alley (now known as Dallas
Street) was home to 46 free blacks, 21 whites, and 1 enslaved worker.
These numbers represent a fraction of Strawberry Alley's actual
residents, since the records only listed heads of households, but we can
still draw some conclusions from them. The 46 free blacks included 35
men. Five were described as mariners and two as caulkers. Seven of the
men owned their properties; presumably the rest were renters. Of the
nine free black women, seven were laundresses, one ran a cook shop, and
one operated an oyster house. The white residents seemed to be of a
slightly higher economic status, with the 13 men and eight women in
artisanal or maritime occupations.[^13]

It's not surprising that the free black women of Strawberry Alley
worked as either laundresses or in food services. These were two common
occupations, both of which provided women with a measure of independence
and control over their time. Laundress was a job almost exclusively held
by black women: the work was hot and exhausting, but done at home,
without white supervision, and allowed a woman to watch her children
while she worked.[^14]

We can find the names of the household heads who lived on Strawberry
Alley much more easily than we can place them on our visualization,
however. One of the challenges that we face as we try to map individuals
is the imprecision of early nineteenth-century addresses (figure 9). No city in the
United States had standardized house numbers before 1828, and Baltimore
did not standardize until the 1840s.[^15] Often we have only north or
south of a given block as our only guide; the tax records often included
east or west side of the street.

{% figure caption: "Figure 9. This visualization shows where people lived along Strawberry Alley.  Dots on the side indicate address is only listed as Strawberry Alley, but with no number or block indicated." %}
![This visualization shows where people lived along Strawberry Alley.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v04/rubin/figure9.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We have placed people in our visualization as accurately as possible.
But for the people we cannot place, we are considering putting them on
the street itself. We may not know exactly where they lived, but we know
that they moved up and down Strawberry Alley, from home to work, to shop
and socialize. Early Baltimore's black residents struggled to make
their way in the world, leaving few traces behind. They faced a constant
threat from a social, legal, and economic system designed to control
them. By recovering and highlighting their lives and work, even to a
limited degree, we remind users that their lives mattered.

[^5]: Researchers read the first available issue of every month, using
    images of the *American Commercial and Daily Advertiser* on Google
    News. They only transcribed advertisements with a Baltimore
    connection, so for example an advertisement for a runaway from
    Virginia that did not mention Baltimore is not included in our
    database. If an advertisement for a position did not indicate a
    preference for race, or the race of the person in question it was
    not included. Many advertisements, especially for runaways, appeared
    multiple times. The year 1816 also featured one advertisement for a
    lost African American child, which is not counted in our totals.

    included slave sales, were destroyed many years ago; only random
    records have survived. See Whitman, *The Price of Freedom,* 208-209.

    31^st^ ult. is probably a reference to October 31, 1819. Had that
    been the day that Harry Moshier escaped, James Biscoe would not have
    been able to place an ad in the November 1 edition of the paper.
