  "A Bridge Between Two Worlds" is part of a larger, ongoing digital project titled "The Tree of Protest." The digital project reconstructs the network infrastructure of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and student activism in the 1960s. This article offers early findings from a spatial analysis of Friends of SNCC chapters. It combines geographic data on the locations of SNCC Projects and Friends of SNCC Chapters with 1960 census data on poverty levels, the racial characteristics of population, per capita income, and median family income to visualize the political and economic significance of SNCC's national organizing. The spatial analysis reveals the strategic geography of SNCC's national fundraising network and suggests new areas of research on student activism in the 1960s.

In late 1962 and early 1963, government officials in Leflore County,
Mississippi cut off the Federal Surplus Commodities Program. The
decision was part of a deliberate effort by the White Citizens Council
to derail the work of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC). In response, SNCC members wrote letters and sent out news
releases to Northern supporters. Students and residents in northern
communities responded. Ivanhoe Donaldson, a Black student at Michigan
State University, gathered donations of food, clothing, and medicine and
drove the supplies South.[^1] Julie Prettyman, opened up her notebook of
wealthy and famous contacts in New York. In 1963, she helped organize a
concert headlined by Harry Belafonte.[^2] The efforts of both Donaldson
and Prettyman were connected to the work of a broad national network of
organized "Friends of SNCC." Following Donaldson's trip from East
Lansing to Mississippi, he started a "Friends of SNCC" at Michigan State
University and later joined SNCC full-time. Prettyman became the
organizing director of the New York Friends of SNCC. In late 1962, when
SNCC drew on Northern resources, there were six chapters with a budget
of $71,927. Two years later, with the expansion of Friends chapters to
fifty-seven, the organization's budget more than quadrupled to
$350,000.[^3] Funds from the chapters supported fieldworkers, Freedom
Houses and Schools, community centers, and voter registration drives.

Work by scholars such as John Dittmer, Charles Payne, and Wesley Hogan
as well as former SNCC activists have illuminated the organization's
distinct style of grassroots organizing, but the geographical
infrastructure and financial function of the organization's national
network has received less scholarly attention.[^4] Between 1961 and
1965, SNCC's national office in Atlanta developed a sophisticated and
flexible network of campus and community groups across the United States
that supported the organization's work in the deep south. James Forman
and Bob Moses, two SNCC staff members, described the national network of
"Friends Chapters" as a "tree."[^5] I use mapping software to visualize
the network's economic and political geography of SNCC's Friends
Network. This spatial analysis of SNCC's national network and social
demographics reveals the ways the organization created a bridge between
the racial and economic worlds of the United States in the 1960s. In
this way, SNCC's grassroots organizing was more than a "local" effort;
it was also a national effort that linked local concerns to raising the
political consciousness of citizens north of the Mason-Dixon line.

Students and staff in SNCC were deeply committed to what historian
Charles Payne defines as the African American Community Organizing
Tradition. In contrast to the community mobilizing practices more
popularly remembered in such events as the March on Washington, that
organizing tradition emphasized the long-term development of leadership
in ordinary men and women. Ella Baker, an adult mentor to SNCC students,
personified the organizing tradition. Working in the NAACP and the
Southern Christian Leadership Council in the 1940s and 1950s, Baker
committed to the slow organizing work of day-to-day meetings---what she
defined as "spadework"---to cultivate community leadership. Baker
believed that the populations most marginalized by the political and
economic system had the knowledge and capacity to change the system. At
the same time, Baker also recognized the need to organize in communities
that were the complete opposite, that is, among communities that
benefited from the political and economic system. While Baker clearly
understood that the Northern white liberal or the charismatic preacher
were hardly models of progressive social change, she also knew that they
could make an important contribution to the movement.[^6]

Baker's organizing philosophy influenced SNCC's fundraising strategy.
From 1962 to 1963, SNCC students developed "Friends of SNCC" chapters
around the United States. As Figure 1 shows, Atlanta, Georgia, where
SNCC was headquartered, served as a fulcrum between the organization's
projects in the South and fundraising efforts in the North. The chapters
linked fundraising and food drives to the community organizing tradition
that emphasized political education and participation. "We in the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee look on Northern Support as
more than fundraising: we want to find a way for concerned individuals
and groups outside the South to play a role in creating racial justice
in the South," SNCC staff explained to Northern supporters. SNCC
fieldworkers underscored that "each fund raising \[sic\] drive should be
seen as an educational effort also, for change in the South depends on a
climate of opinion all over the country which will cause people to
support the movement in the South and demand action from the Federal
government."[^7] In this way, the "Friends of SNCC" chapters maintained
a commitment to grassroots organizing in the Black Belt and poor
communities in the America South while also translating that organizing
strategy in the context of wealthy homes of Martha's Vineyard and
Hollywood.

{% figure caption: "Figure 1. This map demonstrates the geographical reach of Friends of SNCC Chapters. The Atlanta office served as a central organizing hub in terms of communicating news and needs related to the projects to the chapters across the United States. Certain chapters, such as those in the Bay Area and in Boston, did develop their own regional networks. It's also important to note that this map only visualizes the nineteen Friend Chapters listed by SNCC's main Atlanta Office in 1963. By 1965, after SNCC's Mississippi Freedom Summer, Friends of SNCC Chapters increased to seventy-eight." %}

U.S. Census records on 1960 poverty data, racial characteristics of the
population, per capita income, and median family income at the county
level reveals the economic significance of the network. The four census
datasets provide a lens onto the general racial and economic character
of a given community. I visualized the data at the county level and used
grouping analysis to create four distinct categories based on the
natural cluster of the data.[^8] As figure 2 shows, the grouping
analysis of 1960 census data reveals that the American south had the
highest rates of poverty and highest percentage of population defined as
"nonwhite" per 1960 nomenclature while also having the lowest per capita
and median family income. This should not come as a surprise: the data
visualizes the economic effects of Jim Crow and racial segregation.

{% figure caption: "Figure 2. Median Family Income, and Per Capita Income. The chart provides a breakdown of those categories for each color-coded county. When analyzing the map, it's important to keep in mind that the 'nonwhite' identity marker of the 1960 Census Data include Black, Asian, and Indigenous populations. This marker obscures some of the results, especially in Texas, where the Latinx communities were often counted as 'white' in the 1960 census. Nonetheless, the map offers a geographical snapshot of the economic gap between Northern and Southern communities in early 1960, especially along racial lines. The most important figure in terms of economic character is per capita income. Per 1960 Census Categories, the Poverty Threshold for individuals was \$1,490." %}

SNCC’s multi-tiered fundraising strategy is evident when the organization’s network of projects and Friend chapters is overlaid on the 1960 Census data, as shown in figure 3.[^9] On a national scale, SNCC's Friends Network
enabled the organization to draw on the financial resources in the North
to support their work in the South. The main Friends Chapters in 1963
were all located in group 1, or areas of the country with lower poverty
rates and where the Median Family Income and the Per Capita Income were
twice the level of the areas where SNCC projects were located. In this
way, the organization established strategic projects focused on
political empowerment in counties deeply shaped by segregation and Jim
Crow while also developing connections in Northern counties that had the
economic and political power to support their organizing efforts. Spatial analysis, as seen in figure 3, reveals both the economic divide between the North and South in the 1960s *and* the ways SNCC developed a bridge that linked
Northern financial resources to the civil rights struggle in the South.
Bob Moses and James Forman recognized the significance of the
connections when describing SNCC as a tree. "The little small tree,"
they explained, "got its sunshine (which could be money) from the North,
and its rain from the South, in the presence of Southern students who
helped to develop these roots which are now in the communities."[^10]

{% figure caption: "Figure 3. This map visualizes how SNCC's network served as a bridge between two economic and social worlds. The chart provides a picture (color-coded) of the social-economic differences between county locations of SNCC Friends Chapters and Projects. The breakdown reveals some nuances that require further spatial analysis and archival work. SNCC Projects in the South, for instance, were also located in Southern counties that, by some measures, had a strong economic profile and large white population. This begs the question: Why would SNCC locate some projects in predominately white, well-off Southern counties? This breakdown suggests that SNCC's national model functioned at a micro-level in the South, with wealthy white activists like Anne and Carl Braden playing a key role in developing fundraising and organizing among white liberal southerners. But tract-level census data might reveal that these projects were in fact located in areas that were predominantly Black. In addition, both SNCC projects and Friends Chapters were noticeably absent in Group 3, a grouping category that shared the economic characteristics of many SNCC projects, but not the racial makeup. The Project locations listed above, however, do not include those from the 1964-1965 Freedom Summers, when SNCC fieldworkers and Freedom Summer volunteers started 'White Folks Projects' in Biloxi, Mississippi and Ozark, Arkansas, two areas that fell within the Group 3 category." %}

The spatial analysis of SNCC's National Network reveals new areas for
research on SNCC. The first area is SNCC's transregional activism. In
addition to fundraising, Friends of SNCC Chapters were also on the
forefront of civil rights struggles in Northern cities. Lawrence Landry,
who formed the Chicago Friends of SNCC, played a central role in the
1963 Chicago School Boycott, when close to 225,000 students walked out
of school to protest school segregation. Examining the work of SNCC
Friends chapters will further illuminate the civil rights struggles that
extended beyond the Mason-Dixon line as well as the unique political
dynamics that influenced and constrained efforts in the North.[^11] The
second area is the vital role of SNCC Friends Chapters in the
recruitment of students and other volunteers. The 1964 Freedom Summer,
for instance, has been the subject of extensive scholarship.[^12] Yet,
scholars have not demonstrated how SNCC was able to recruit close to
1,000 students from across the United States. Early research on the
location of SNCC Friends Chapters shows that 65% of the chapters were
located on or near college campuses. Moreover, linking the Friends
chapter locations with where the summer volunteers traveled from will
reveal the strategic significance of SNCC Friends Chapters in the
recruitment of lawyers, ministers, students, and teachers from across
the United States. Future work will integrate other elements of spatial
analysis, digital archiving (oral histories), and deep mapping to
illuminate SNCC activism in Northern cities and recruitment.

The digital methodologies used for this project offer new tools of
analysis for historians and scholars of social movements. Digital
historians have used spatial analysis to reveal the ways federal and
state policies structurally embedded class, gender, and racial
inequalities in the American economic and political system.[^13] Other
historians have turned to digital technologies to map and archive the
locations of sit-ins, protests, and related activities associated with
the civil rights movement, labor unions, student activism, and women
suffrage.[^14] Combining both forms of digital research makes it
possible to critically examine the political and economic importance of
protest and organizing location and the sophisticated tactics that
activists employed to address deeply rooted inequalities.
