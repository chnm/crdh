abstract: |
  Anti-slavery efforts have long served as the ostensible setting of early struggles for Black freedom and equal rights in the United States, including both the Colored Conventions and the early Black press. Recent collection, digitization, and data curation efforts, however, have made it possible to test that view using social network analysis. Based on this analysis, I show that early Black activist communities cannot be collapsed into the white-led abolitionist circuits. The Colored Conventions and the early Black press operated independently of the anti-slavery societies across six regionally distinct communities. A brief survey of these regional communities points to the wealth of research opportunities among robust, rediscovered, and reassembled archives into areas that speak to enduring questions of rights, resistance, and community-building. These inquiries simultaneously demonstrate the need for careful attention to Black data curation practices, especially with regard to inclusive approaches to scattered archives.

Anti-slavery societies have long served as the ostensible setting of
early struggles for Black freedom and equal rights in the United States.
By most accounts, nineteenth-century African American agitation happened
under the umbrella of anti-slavery groups and their iconic, usually
white leaders, such as William Lloyd Garrison. This view continues to
serve as the default framework through which scholars organize their
research on early African American history and culture. A post in late
2018 on the *Black Perspectives* blog, for example, comments that "the
early meetings \[of the Colored Conventions\] focused primarily on the
abolition of slavery." Similarly, the early Black press has suffered
neglect in proportion to the broader assumption that it was merely a
subset of abolitionist publications, despite the assertions of
specialists such as Frankie Hutton, Eric Gardner, and Jacqueline
Bacon.[^1] A consequence of this framework is the prominence and broad
familiarity with the work of white abolitionists, writers, and editors
and the obscurity of their uncounted peers in Black-led newspapers,
conventions, and many other organizations and spaces. This paper
presents a macroscopic view of both anti-slavery and Black-led groups to
dislocate those racial contours that inhibit scholarship in the archives
of nineteenth-century collective Black life through social network
analysis in four related arenas: Colored Conventions, the Black press,
the Underground Railroad, and prominent anti-slavery societies.

I argue that the fractured structure of the communities revealed by this
analysis precludes describing any of the major components as a single
community, much less as encompassed by a single organization like the
anti-slavery societies. Instead early Black organizing appears as much
more diffuse and regionally distinct than has yet been recognized. This
picture suggests a legion of new research opportunities to understand
the regional diversity of antebellum activist communities, particularly
as historians can recast existing frameworks away from anti-slavery and
the Underground Railroad to represent more fully the broad, diverse, and
shifting landscape of nineteenth-century Black organizing.

The data for this research necessarily comes from a wide variety of
archives. No central collection of the Colored Conventions or Black
press exists. Both conventions and newspapers blossomed in hundreds of
locations across the United States. Given the scattered records of these histories, it has taken hundreds of hours over seven years to prepare these digital collections and associated datasets. These processes involved making interpretive decisions that shaped the digital materials.[^2] These decisions included common steps to establish scope
and selection principles, but also the role of incomplete evidence in
heterogeneous archives. How, for example, might a dataset describe a
publication that is referenced by a number of its contemporaries, yet no
physical copy is currently known to exist? My collaborators and I have
determined to develop these materials on an iterative and inclusive
model. Keep the fragmentary data, record the uncertainty, and broadcast
the information widely. Access begets research, and perhaps new research
will unearth new details, illuminate previously unknown connections, or
point out why entirely different frameworks are needed.

The Colored Conventions show the need for iterative models. In 2012, a
group at the University of Delaware began to assemble a digital
collection of the minutes and proceedings from the Colored Conventions.
Reprint volumes from the 1960s and 1970s contained approximately sixty
conventions, but additional research has identified evidence for more
than 450 African American conventions held during the nineteenth
century. Given that scale, prior articles and books on the Colored
Conventions have more in common with micro-history than longue dur√©e
views.[^3] For the period before Emancipation (1830-1864), the results
of the Colored Conventions Project today include materials from
forty-eight state and national Colored Conventions.

The history of the early Black press rewards just such an inclusive
approach. Bibliographies and scholarly publications from the twentieth
century provide accounts of approximately two-dozen antebellum
newspapers and magazines edited by African Americans. Thanks to the
wealth of digitized materials it is now possible to assert the existence
of fifty-six publications with at least one hundred people who served as
editors or publishers.[^4] Issues from over half of those publications
(31) survive while the remaining (24) titles survive only as the
attributed source of texts reprinted in other newspapers.

In contrast, the path from archival materials to actionable datasets for
the Underground Railroad and anti-slavery societies is much shorter. In
1898, a historian named Wilbur Siebert published a book, *The
Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom,* with an appendix titled
"Directory of the Names of Underground Railroad Operators" that listed
more than three thousand names.[^5] The Boston Public Library (BPL)
digitized their Anti-Slavery Collection of over 40,000 items, including
the papers and correspondence of many of the most notable white
abolitionists and anti-slavery societies.[^6] Like Siebert's data, the
Anti-Slavery Collection has an unequal coverage by race and region, but
the coverage is not so uneven that the BPL's metadata cannot be brought
into conversation with the Colored Conventions to ask questions about
regional networks over space and time.[^7] All of this data is vexed;
some of it can be useful.

 These extenuating conditions are worth elaborating because they justify
the use of social network analysis. This paper investigates the
structure of these communities. This focus on the collective, rather
than more granular views, provides a way to characterize the relations
across these four arenas at scale. Graphs of the relations between these
collective bodies are less objective representations of historical links
than charts of correspondences across multiple, large, digital archives.
A collective graph is a proxy but not a substitute for the range of
possible inquiries into the lived experiences recorded in these
archives. At the same time, network analysis of these archives at scale
shows that, despite frequent invocations of scarcity and loss, there is
a lot of material to gather. The strongest illustration of this argument
lies in the revived capacity of the Colored Conventions to organize
nineteenth-century African American history.

As a social network, the early Colored Conventions fall into six groups,
each containing one or more convention, that constitute regional
clusters. A full graph of the antebellum movement includes 1751 nodes
(names and conventions) and 2306 links (lines that express attendance at
a particular convention).[^8] More than four-fifths of the convention
delegates did not attend more than one convention, so it augments the
analysis to make a projection of the links from delegate-convention to
shared attendance. As a result, the triads in this network
\[convention\<=\>delegate\<=\>convention\] can be projected and
simplified to dyads \[convention\<=\>convention\]. The shared attendance
network of these dyads, when a basic modularity algorithm is applied,
reveals the following six groupings: 1. Pennsylvania Conventions, 2. Border State Conventions, 3. California Conventions, 4. A Maryland Convention, 5. Northeastern Conventions, and 6. Transnational Conventions (see figure 1).[^9]

{% figure caption: "Figure 1. This graph shows Antebellum state and national conventions in six groups that are roughly equivalent to regions. The six regional groups are Pennsylvania (orange); Northeastern (purple); Transnational (blue); California (dark green); Border States (light green); and Maryland (red)." %}
![Newtwork graph of six regional groupings of state and national conventions.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/casey/figure1.png)
{% endfigure %}

Figures two, three, and four show a comparison of the six regional communities of the Colored Conventions and their links with the Black press, the Underground Railroad (UGRR), and the anti-slavery societies (AS). The differences can be stark. The Maryland group is comprised of a single state convention, held in 1852, and has zero links to the other
arenas. Where mob violence broke down the collective body of activists
in Maryland, physical distance produces much the same effect for the
regional community of Black California, which has only a few links with
the UGRR and none with AS groups. The other four regions are much more
connected to the other arenas, but even among these there are important
regional differences. Some of these structural patterns are intuitive.
In Pennsylvania, there are many more links to the UGRR than to AS
groups. This pattern makes sense given the prominence of Black
Philadelphia activists, such as the Still, Shadd, and Gloucester
families. For the Northeastern conventions (roughly north and east of
New Jersey) there are a much larger number of links forged by
periodicals. The role of these periodicals as sites of exchange among
the four arenas in the Northeast makes sense given that more than half
of early African American newspapers were published in New York state.
Newspapers also played a key role for the Transnational group of
conventions that included upper Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and into
Ontario, Canada. The outlier in this comparative set of views is the
group of Border State conventions. While a handful of states shared
borders with slaveholding states, the conventions in Indiana and Ohio
fostered different kinds of relationships with AS and UGRR groups.

{% figure caption: "Figure 2. These two graphs show the full clusters of the regional communities of Pennsylvania and the northeast US, along with their respective connections to the Underground Railroad and Anti-Slavery groups. The small number of links in the middle of these triangles shows the scarcity of cross-connections." %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 3. These two graphs show the full transnational and California clusters, along with their respective connections to the Underground Railroad and Anti-Slavery groups. The California conventions do not have any links to the Anti-Slavery Collection, and only two connections with the Underground Railroad data. Likely other organizational bodies were more relevant, such as the Prince Hall Free Masons, AME Church, and Black economic networks in San Francisco and Sacramento." %}
![Two newtwork graphs, showing the transnational and California culsters.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/casey/figure3.png)
{% endfigure %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 4. These two graphs show the full groups in the border states and in Maryland. The border states include Ohio and Indiana, as Illinois was marginally more connected to the transnational conventions in Michigan and Ontario. The Maryland graph does not include any UGRR or ASC figures because it is isolated, or lacking any external connections. Note that this would change during Reconstruction, but the minutes of the Maryland Free Colored People's Convention from 1852 document an outbreak of racist mob violence that prevented any further public displays of Black activism or organizing in Baltimore during the antebellum era. For more on this convention, see Colored Conventions project, [‚ÄúMaryland Free Colored People's Convention, July 27-28, 1852.‚Äù](http://coloredconventions.org/items/show/260)" %}
![Two newtwork graphs, showing the border states and Maryland culsters.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/casey/figure4.png)
{% endfigure %}

These collective relationships become clearer with a view focused on the
people who created links across each of the four arenas (see figure 5). By filtering the network graphs to display only those entities with two or more connections, the following set of graphs are created in figures six through eight. Here, again, the differences are not subtle. In the sparser regional communities of California and Maryland, few or no connections bridge the
four arenas. In Pennsylvania, the convention, UGRR, and AS groups are
linked only through newspapers published outside the region---*The North
Star*, the *Aliened American* and Stephen Myers's various upstate New
York papers. The Northeastern, Border State, and Transnational regional
communities in this view have roughly even numbers of links distributed
between the arenas. The small corps of individuals in these networks who
bridged multiple communities are revealed as cross-communal brokers that
constitute a starting point for future research on multi-modal activism
and organizing.

{% figure caption: "Figure 8. These two graphs show the border state and Maryland clusters, filtered to show people with two or more links.

![Two newtwork graphs of the border states and Maryland culsters, filtered to show entities with 2+ links.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/casey/figure8.png)
{% endfigure %}

When the graphs are filtered to show only entities with three or more links, the resulting views (figure 9-11) show how marginal the Underground Railroad and anti-slavery societies were for the networks of Black activism. California and Maryland are isolated. For the Border States, only two men---David Jenkins and James Poindexter---show links
to the UGRR. For people in the populations served by the Transnational
groups, it is hard to assert that the Underground Railroad and
anti-slavery groups did not play any role, yet in the graph the only
connecting node is through the famed white abolitionist, John Brown.
Brown only appears in the graph because of his role at the Chatham
Convention (Ontario) on a single night not long before the raid on
Harper's Ferry. By contrast, the Pennsylvania and Northeastern regional
communities are much denser, and invite additional scrutiny as they
overlap in time very little. The Pennsylvania regional community might
fairly be described as a graph of the national Black leadership in the
1830s, while the Northeastern graph contains the majority of the most
well-known Black leaders, newspapers, and national conventions from the
1840s and 1850s. That is, these two graphs suggest that the shift from
1830s Pennsylvania to 1840s-1850s New York was driven by the
simultaneous rise of Black conventions and newspapers adjacent to or
separate from Underground Railroad or anti-slavery organizations.

{% endfigure %}

Ultimately, the six communities described in this paper are not
identical. Recognition of these regional differences pushes against
flattening them into easily comparable units, but it also calls
attention to the specific structures of nineteenth-century activist
communities. Black leaders and activists created those communities in
response to difference moments, contexts, and immediate or long-term
needs. The shape and series of changes in each of the regional
communities deserves far greater attention to gain greater
understandings of the hemispheric and local contexts. Part of the work to be done involves more archival research in these arenas and their contemporaries‚ÄîBlack churches, Free Masons, schools, mutual aid societies, vigilance committees‚Äîas well as further inquiry in the archives of the Underground Railroad and anti-slavery networks.

That continuing work recalls one of the more common parliamentary
gestures used in the Colored Conventions. During a meeting, participants
would form committees and break out into separate discussions and tasks.
Towards the end of a meeting, it would become time to reassemble and
merge the various efforts into a larger, coherent, and heterogeneous
collective body capable of surpassing any one of the committees. The
meeting would then resolve itself into "A Committee of the Whole."
Perhaps this gesture might serve as a model for the next generation of
digital histories of early Black organizing in the nineteenth-century
United States.

    appendix is far from comprehensive. Unequal racial coverage in the
    appendix is only one of many problems with Siebert's data. Siebert
    notes in the appendix that "the names of colored operators are
    marked with a ‚Ä†."‚Å† Revealingly, Siebert assumes the default race of
    UGRR operators as white. The distribution of operators by race
    illustrates his perspective. Only 5% (151) of the operators are
    marked as Black. That obviously does not reflect the reality of the
    thousands of people of color who assisted refugees from the South.
    Even with these deficits, historians from Eric Foner to Cheryl
    LaRoche find the 1898 appendix nevertheless useful for engaging with
    the larger patterns of the Underground Railroad.

    several of his closest colleagues and fellow abolitionists. While
    not exhaustive, the BPL-ASC includes many of the most notable white
    abolitionists and the American, Massachusetts, and New England
    Anti-Slavery Societies. It would be difficult to argue that the
    collection does not offer a representative sample of white-led
    anti-slavery societies.
