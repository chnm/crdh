### Introduction

In 1724, two Ottoman governors combined forces and set out to bring the
rebellious Algerian tribes to heel. In the eastern province of
Constantine, they successfully took the mutinous Henanecha tribe by
surprise. In the midst of defeat, Sheikh Bou Aziz prepared 8,000 head of
cattle and goods to turn over to the Ottoman conquerors. Before he could
deliver the property, however, his daughter Euldjia mounted her horse
and rallied both men *and* women to attack the Turkish army. Together,
the Henanecha drove the Turks into a hasty retreat and took the Ottoman
lieutenant governor captive.[^1] Songs and oral traditions of the
Henanecha recorded in the mid-nineteenth century still celebrated her
heroism more than a century after her bold action saved the
community.[^2] Euldjia is not the only remarkable Algerian woman,
however.

While the history of Ottoman Algeria remains understudied, the history
of Algerian women during this time period is practically unknown. Extant
scholarship focuses almost exclusively on male officials in the Ottoman
administration, effectively ignoring the larger socio-political context
in which they operated.[^3] Over the course of nearly 300 years, as
Ottoman and non-Ottoman governors struggled to suppress the recalcitrant
clans of the eastern province of Algeria and sustain control, Algerian
women proved invaluable partners in those efforts. After the
mid-seventeenth century, most Ottoman officials married into a local
family as one of the surest ways to establish their legitimacy among the
Algerian elite. Ironically, the Sultan had banned the very unions that
maintained Ottoman sovereignty in Algeria, but due to its increasingly
marginalized position within the empire, officials in the regency were
able to stretch beyond the confines of official policy. Most studies of
Ottoman Algeria focus on masculine forms of political power. In
contrast, this study contends that local women served as arbiters of
Ottoman administrators' right to rule in Algeria. Through their
acceptance or denial of imperial officials' marriage proposals, Algerian
women conferred power or marked the suitor as unworthy of high office.
Therefore, women played a significant role in shaping Ottoman-Algerian
social politics and maintaining Ottoman sovereignty.

The few extant fragments of knowledge from Ottoman Algeria emerge from
French and Arabic chronicles of the governors, travel narratives, and
consular records.[^4] Through text mining to extract named and unnamed
entities, and social network visualization to illustrate their
relationships, unnamed women's spectral presence may be represented
despite their absence in the archival record. [^5] These kinship
connections and the sub-communities to which they give rise can be
meaningfully investigated quantitatively using social network analysis
measures, such as betweenness centrality scores. By examining these
quantitative measures, we learn more about both named and unnamed
women's positions within the structure of Ottoman-Algerian society.
Through an analysis of the individual lives, relationships and
underlying structure that make up the Ottoman-Algerian network in
Constantine between 1567 and 1837, I argue that Algerian women were
essential intercultural mediators and conduits to power.

This study is also part of a wider historiography that explores how the
intimate aspects of life, particularly sex and marriage, have played a
significant and explicit role in imperial politics and policies since
the sixteenth century.[^6] Consequently, the methods described herein
may be used in widely disparate contexts, from webs of dynastic and
elite relationships in China or Renaissance Europe to kinship networks
in Dutch Java, as well as among Native Americans and European settlers
in North America.[^7] The paired processes of text mining relational
data and analyzing the resulting network allow scholars to recover the
social positions and roles of both named and unnamed women, Indigenous
and enslaved peoples, and others who are largely absent from
predominantly elite, masculine, and colonizer-centric archives.[^8]

With a data set as complete as available sources allowed, I produced a
series of three network visualizations and statistics for the most
expansive graph to study the socio-political world of Ottoman Algeria.
The first network image (shown in figure 1) depicts only individuals
named in the records; the second graph (shown in figure 2) incorporates
individuals who were not named but were explicitly referenced; and the
final graph (seen in figure 3) includes individuals whose existence we inferred
through the extant relationships in our data set. For instance, if a
father-son relationship appeared in the documents, a woman had to be
involved in order to bring that son into the world, so another node was
added for the woman and linked to both the known father and son in the
edges list.

{% figure caption: "Figure 1: This graph depicts the Ottoman-Algerian Social Network (1567-1837) with only individuals who were explicitly named in the source materials. Women are shown in orange; men are gray. In this graph, only 12 named individuals are women (out of a total of 105) or just 11 percent. This figure, along with figures 2 and 3, justify the novel method of analysis employed in this study by showing how comparatively few women were explicitly named in the sources; however, by adding referenced women and those identified by inference, we generate a much more complete socio-political network of Ottoman Algeria. The women identified in this way were historically significant, even though we do not know their names, an argument borne out by the betweenness centrality scores presented in figure 4 and the accompanying analysis." %}

{% endfigure %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 2: This graph depicts the Ottoman-Algerian Social Network (1567-1837) with both individuals who were explicitly named and those who were directly referenced in the source materials. For example, you will see “Daughter of Ahmed El-Koli” listed in the lower left corner of the graph because she was referenced in the documents as Ahmed El-Koli's daughter and as the wife of Salah Bey; she is therefore connected by edges to both of these men. Women are shown in orange; men are gray. In this graph of both named and referenced individuals, 24 out of 140 individuals shown are women, increasing the proportion of women from 11 to 26 percent. " %}

{% endfigure %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 3: This graph represents the Ottoman-Algerian Social Network (1567-1837) with individuals who were named and referenced in the sources, as well as individuals whose existence was inferred through existing relationships. The most common way the research team identified an individual by inference was by completing a family unit. If a father and son were named or referenced in the sources, we added a woman as the partner of the father and mother of the son. In this graph, 55 out of 159 individuals shown are women, increasing the proportion of women from 26 to 35 percent." %}
![Network graph, showing Ottoman-Algerian Social Network with named, referenced, and inferred individuals.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v03/sanders/figure3.png)
{% endfigure %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 4: Raw numbers and proportions of men and women in the three social network graphs depicted above. In the initial graph of named individuals alone, only 11 percent of the people represented are women (12/105 individuals). By adding unnamed but referenced persons, the proportion of women more than doubled to 26 percent (36/140). In the final graph, which includes inferred individuals, the ratio of women to men increased to about one in three (35 percent or 55/159)." %}

***Number and Proportions of Individuals in the Social Network Graphs by Gender and Identification Type***

| Gender | Named | Referenced (% = Named + Referenced) | Inference (% is cumulative) | Row Totals |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Men | 93 (89%) | 11 (74%) | 0 (65%) | 104 |
| Women | 12 (11%) | 24 (26%) | 19 (35%) | 55 |
| **Column Totals** | 105 | 35 | 19 | 159 |

{% endfigure %}

By adding individuals who are referenced but unnamed and those whose
existence we may infer, we observe both an absolute and relative growth
in the number and proportion of women in the social network. This
process sheds light on both the social positions and kinship relations
of many women whose names were not recorded. This is not merely a
numbers game. The more people we can accurately represent in the graph,
the better sense we have for the structure of relationships and the
relative positions of men and women of various ethnicities in the
society under consideration. It is this structure that we can
meaningfully explore with network analysis.

### Critical Considerations

An examination of Ottoman-Algerian social networks in the period prior
to the French invasion, sheds light on the ways in which women,
marriage, and kinship connections legitimated Ottoman rule, but these
insights come with a number of caveats. On the one hand, we must
remember that network visualization collapses timelines, which may lead
to false conclusions. On the other, due to the nature of our source
materials, adding time to these graphs would reveal more about the
availability or scarcity of data rather than present a complete picture
of the extent of intermarriage in each time period. Although this
paucity of sources is an important aspect of the story of Algerian
women's marginalization in the archive, it does not shed light on their
lived experience or roles in society, which is the present study's
objective.[^9]

What social networks and their quantitative measures cannot tell us is
as important as what they can. Although we can make educated guesses
about the daily pursuits and experiences of the women in these graphs,
without additional source materials, we cannot know what they thought
about their marriages, politics, relations with their neighbors or any
other topic in which we might be interested. In its very name, data
visualization, promises to render things---people, identities,
relations, etc.---visible, legible, and therefore knowable.
Nevertheless, to see is not necessarily to know; data visualization
reveals certain kinds of information, but it occludes others. It may
even recapitulate the violence of the past by reducing people to numbers
and objects. In light of this risk, it is important for scholars to
offer humanistic readings of our data and source materials. By finding
and highlighting the human experiences represented in our charts, we
honor the fact that the numbers represent real, often marginalized,
lives.

### Betweenness Centrality and Women's Positions in Ottoman-Algerian Society

Kinship connections can be meaningfully investigated quantitatively
using social network analysis measures. Betweenness centrality scores
are particularly informative because they highlight the individuals who
served as essential bridges between people, family units, and
socio-political cliques. Technically, betweenness centrality is a
measure of the number of shortest paths that travel through a node.[^10]
Therefore, those with the highest rankings forged and maintained links
between Ottoman officials and local families, bolstering Ottoman
sovereignty in this frontier province. Imperial officers depended on
these connections both to govern effectively and for their own safety
and security while in office. Of the top twenty-five individuals, ranked
by betweenness centrality, eleven (forty-four percent) are women. This
proportion of women to men is much higher than one would expect by
chance, given that women account for only thirty-five percent of the
individuals in the graph. Furthermore, of these eleven women, seven of
them are unnamed but explicitly referenced in the documents.

{% figure caption: "Figure 5: Individuals in the Ottoman-Algerian social network presented in figure 3, ranked by betweenness centrality as calculated with Networkx in Python and graphed with Tableau. Individuals highlighted in orange are women. In this chart, women account for 44 percent of the top individuals ranked by betweenness centrality (11/25), and of these, most (7/11) are unnamed in the documents, as signaled in the chart above by a relationship reference rather than a name (e.g., Daughter of Ahmed-El-Kolli). Despite the absence of their names in the sources, their presence in the community as intermediaries was significant because, through their acceptance or denial of marriage proposals, they served as the arbiters of Ottoman officials’ worthiness and therefore legitimacy." %}
![Horizontal bar graph, showing the betweeeness centrality scores for individuals in the Ottoman-Algerian Social Network.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v03/sanders/figure5.png)
{% endfigure %}

Marriages between Ottoman administrators and local women not only forged
alliances between the officials and Algerian elites, but also to former
governors as well.[^11] This is, in part, why so many women appear among
the top individuals ranked by betweenness centrality scores, as seen in
figure 4. Generations of interconnections formed powerful
Ottoman-Algerian indigenous ruling families, through which, access to
local power was transmitted through women, rather than solely from
father to son (see Deikha's story below). Much like the royal women in
Istanbul, Algerian women and their mixed-ethnicity daughters became
guardians of Ottoman sovereignty through their various roles as brides,
wives, mothers, and counsellors for their husbands. Marriages between
Ottoman officials and local women served as one of the surest avenues to
power for ambitious men. Such marriages were a seal of approval for
officials newly assigned to the eastern province, and provided Ottoman
administrators access to local political and military networks. What is
more, with their knowledge of local customs, hierarchies, and tribal
relations, locally-born women became advisors and translators for their
Ottoman husbands. Through their relationship with imperial
administrators, Algerian women served as caretakers of Ottoman
sovereignty at the very edge of empire.

A woman's consent was, therefore, an essential ingredient in the Ottoman
recipe for hegemony in Algeria. This is no more apparent than when
consent was withheld. Toward the end of his tenure, Governor Salah Bey
(r. 1771--1792) sought to consolidate support in his province and
therefore needed the backing of the dominant tribes. In this effort,
Salah Bey contracted an agreement with Sheikh Brahim ben Bou Aziz to
marry Brahim's daughter to formalize their alliance. When the moment
arrived for the bridal procession to depart for Constantine, the
bride-to-be refused to leave her quarters, pleading with her father to
break off the engagement. At last, giving in to her tearful entreaties,
the sheikh acquiesced and sent a messenger to deliver the unfortunate
news.[^12] The rejection of Brahim's daughter had dire consequences for
the governor. Without these essential allies, Salah Bey was assassinated
a year later.

Through marriage, local elite women and their mixed-ethnicity daughters
brought subsequent generations of officials into the blended
Ottoman-Algerian political elite. In the early eighteenth century,
Ottoman General Bou Hanek (r. 1736--1754) married into a powerful
Algerian family and established a mixed Ottoman-Algerian household. When
one of his daughters, unnamed in the sources, came of age, Bou Hanek
arranged her marriage to his lieutenant governor, Hossein. Through this
union, Bou Hanek anointed his successor. Like his father-in-law before
him, Hossein agreed to the marriage of his own daughter, Deikha, to
Abd-Allah Bey, an influential Ottoman official who became governor in
1804.

{% figure caption: "Figure 6. Deikha's family tree demonstrates how Ottoman administrators transferred power through their daughters' marriages rather than from father to son. Each of these marriages preceded the man's appointment to the governorship. Therefore, to access power, newly arrived officials, including Bou Hanek, Hossein Bey, and Abd-Allah Bey, needed to earn the trust and approval of local women and their families. By doing so, they also earned the trust of the local community, thereby establishing their legitimacy to govern. " %}
![Family tree for Deikha, showing three generations of intermarriage between Algerian or Algerian/Ottoman women and Ottoman men.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v03/sanders/figure6.png)
{% endfigure %}

Deikha may be exceptional in that she is named in the sources and ranks
in the top third of women by betweenness centrality, but the counsel she
provided as the wife of a provincial governor was not unique.[^13] Her
story reveals the ways in which locally-born women served as cultural
translators and counsellors for Ottoman officials. Deikha was known for
her energy, wisdom, and diplomacy. Like other elite women who married
Ottoman officials, Deikha would have been well educated, both literate
and numerate, and well prepared to manage a large household.[^14] As
Hossein Bey's daughter and Abd-Allah's wife, Deikha capitalized on her
family's connections and cultivated advantageous relationships with
Ottoman officials, Constantine's bourgeoisie, and rural sheikhs. Her
deft social skills and political acumen also won her the support and
admiration of Abd-Allah's council who sought her advice when facing
thorny questions of governance. Each woman's willingness to enter into
the proposed marriages legitimated their Ottoman husbands in the eyes of
the Algerian community. The example set by Bou Hanek, his Algerian
wives, and mixed-ethnicity daughters led to the creation of a powerful
Ottoman-Algerian family that influenced provincial politics for nearly a
century.[^15]

### Conclusion

The network graphs depicted above show more than family trees. They
demonstrate the interconnected nature of the composite Ottoman-Algerian
society that developed in Constantine after the region became an Ottoman
imperial province in the early sixteenth century. Analyzing these
networks computationally offers significant insight into the structure
of this society. Through marriage to imperial administrators, local
women connected Algeria to the Ottoman Empire, legitimized their
husbands' authority in the province, and bore children who embodied the
tensions of empire---neither fully Turkish, nor fully Algerian. Both
Algerian women and their mixed-ethnicity daughters were key links in the
chain that bound Algeria to the Ottoman Empire.

Social network analysis of Ottoman Algerian society complicates the
masculine picture of Ottoman imperial governance and suggests that women
were key mediators between the imperial administration and the local
population. Previous scholarship has only examined male roles in
household formation and political ascendance, but the data gathered and
examined in the social networks above show how marriages between local
women and imperial administrators were essential to a man's path to the
governorship and to the maintenance of Ottoman sovereignty in early
modern Algeria.

    Suleiman Hodali---without whom this study would not have been
    possible, particularly within the timeframe in which we completed
    the data mining and modeling. For another work that uses a similar
    approach to explore the gaps and silences concerning both free and
    enslaved African Americans, see Klein, "The Image of Absence."

[^10]: The shortest path between two nodes is the path with the fewest
    edges and is taken as a measure of distance or closeness between
    nodes. In a social network graph where nodes represent individuals,
    when a node is a member of many shortest paths, it demonstrates that
    person's "centrality" to the connections that exist between many
    other individuals. As historians increasingly turn to network
    analysis to study communities in the past, we are finding that women
    often tend to rank higher in betweenness centrality scores, so it
    seems to be a good measure to use when looking for women's roles and
    positions within a network. See Maeve Kane, "All One People."

[^15]: We see a similar pattern in the family of Ahmed Bey El Kolli, who
    married into the Ben Gana and Muqrani families. His Turkish son,
    Mohammed Chérif, followed his father's example and married into the
    Ben Gana family. Mohammed rose to the position of Khalifa, serving
    in this capacity for several governors. Mohammed's son, Ahmed,
    learned these lessons well, and contracted at least seven unions
    with local women to secure support among the various tribes both in
    and outside the province of Constantine. Ahmed, in turn, became a
    provincial governor, the last before the French conquest of the
    provincial capital in 1837. Temimi, *Le Beylik*, 60--70; Ruedy,
