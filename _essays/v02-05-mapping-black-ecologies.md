  This essay is our first effort in a long-term collective project organized to collect historical and contemporary narratives from Black communities that offer alternative epistemic entry points for historicizing and interrupting mounting ecological crisis. We use the space of this essay to lay the conceptual groundwork for this collaborative effort through our primary concept, Black ecologies. On the one hand, this idea provides a way of historicizing and analyzing the ongoing reality that Black communities in the US South and in the wider African Diaspora are most susceptible to the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels, subsidence, sinking land, as well as the ongoing effects of toxic stewardship. On the other hand, Black ecologies names the corpus of insurgent knowledge produced by these same communities, which we hold to have bearing on how we should historicize the current crisis and how we conceive of futures outside of destruction.

This essay is our first effort in a long-term collective project
organized to collect historical and contemporary narratives from Black
communities that offer alternative epistemic entry points for
historicizing and interrupting mounting ecological crisis. We use the
space of this essay to lay the conceptual groundwork for this
collaborative effort (which has not yet materialized a website) through
our primary concept, Black ecologies.[^1] On the one hand, this idea
provides a way of historicizing and analyzing the ongoing reality that
Black communities in the US South and in the wider African Diaspora are
most susceptible to the effects of climate change, including rising sea
levels, subsidence, sinking land, as well as the ongoing effects of
toxic stewardship. On the other hand, Black ecologies names the corpus
of insurgent knowledge produced by these same communities, which we hold
to have bearing on how we should historicize the current crisis and how
we conceive of futures outside of destruction.

On October 11, 2018, social media began to be inundated with posts form
rural communities throughout Central and Tidewater Virginia. Many
reported that wind and rain had begun to pick up around their houses.
Although this batch of storms was anticipated by weather forecasters as
part of the movement northward of hurricane and then tropical storm
Michael, the terror of these storms was not diminished for many of the
people in the region. Within the three years since February 2015 when a
cell destroyed [a 150-year old Black Church, St. John's Baptist of Desha, Virginia](http://www.newblackmaninexile.net/2016/02/reflections-on-tornado-that-destroyed.html?view=classic),
and a number of homes in Essex County as well as across the Rappahannock
River in Naylor's Beach, people in rural Tidewater Virginia have been
terrified by the prospects of these violent storms. Virginians,
especially those in vulnerable rural communities, have already had to define a new normal based on the likelihood of destructive weather because of the changing climate.

At least five tornadoes were later identified as having touched down
across the state. The above footage shot by Sherita Mahone of Middlesex
County, Virginia shows a large tree toppled near her home. She along
with many of the residents of the area remained without power for
several days. Her clip maps infrastructural vulnerability for people
inhabiting the scarps and terraces of the Tidewater. She is, like the
many registering fear on social media as the storms approached, an
active cartographer of the overlapping ecological and social
susceptibility that defines life for Black communities in the region and
beyond. Both rural and urban Black communities in the Tidewater of
Virginia and Southern Louisiana, for example, are particularly
vulnerable to rising water and the intensification of acute weather
events. Inhabiting low lying land, disproportionately in mobile homes
and other vulnerable structures, and often situated in bayous, wetlands,
and clearings between groves of soft and easily wind-toppled pine trees
on the cheapest land, working-class Black Southerners face immediate
danger in weather events exacerbated by climate change as well as the
long-term effects of coastal subsidence and the rising water table.

Events of environmental catastrophe lay bare the core dimensions of the
social sphere in which they occur. Both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane
Harvey exposed the matrix of inequality that existed along the United
States' Gulf Coast and in the Tidewater of Virginia. As geographers [Katherine McKittrick and Clyde Woods](https://www.worldcat.org/title/black-geographies-and-the-politics-of-place/oclc/608374920) explain, these storms "brought into clear
focus, at least momentarily, a legacy of uneven geographies, of those
locations long occupied by *les damnés* *de la terre*/the wretched of
the earth: the geographies of the homeless, the jobless, the
incarcerated, the invisible laborers, the underdeveloped, the
criminalized, the refugee, the kicked about, the impoverished, the
abandoned, the unescaped"[^2]. In Katrina's aftermath, the ideological
and physical violence imposed upon Black life was flung into the
international spotlight. World news media broadcast images of low income
and working-class African Americans, clinging to their rooftops and
attics, praying to be rescued from their flooded homes. It is from this
international gaze that the world began to become aware of what many in
the United States knew already.

{% figure caption: "Figure 4. Overall population loss in New Orleans from 2000--2010.
The predominantly Black working-class areas of New Orleans East, Lower
Ninth Ward, and Seventh Ward were most heavily affected by population
loss after Katrina. Note the “sliver by the river,” a natural crest
along the Mississippi River that has a greater chance of escaping total
inundation when Hurricanes strike greater New Orleans. That area,
corresponding with the racial topography of New Orleans, has come to be
inhabited primarily by whites." %}

{% endfigure %}

A willful distortion of reality is required to suggest that Hurricane
Katrina suddenly created the social vulnerability of Black Americans
(particularly those living in the US South), as if public policy had not
been purposefully divesting from working-class Black communities for
decades. This divestment diminished not only the political and economic
resources of these communities, but also their ability to withstand
events of ecological catastrophe. Within the vortex of media coverage,
many Black celebrities used the heightened attention to spread messages
about the state's indifference to the people killed and displaced by
Katrina. Songs from rappers [Lil' Wayne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkA3p3YqH9U) and
Juvenile, in addition to New Orleans-based independent rappers, levied
poignant critiques at not only the federal government and local police
response to Hurricane Katrina, but also towards an American civil
society that places Black men, women, and children beyond the pale of
citizenship or incorporation into the body politic, into a liminal space
of raw intergenerational vulnerability. As, Lil' Wayne maps in his
ingenious critique of the Bush Administration's response to Katrina:

> I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
> New Orleans baby, now the White House hating
> Trying to wash us away like we not on the map
> Wait, have you heard the latest
> They saying that you gotta have paper if you tryna come back
> Niggas thinking it's a wrap
> See we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
> Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses
>
> ---[Lil' Wayne and Robin Thicke, "Georgia...Bush"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAYbiptPSIg)[^3]

> Excuse me if I'm on one
> And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
> They try tell me keep my eyes open
> My whole city underwater, some people still floatin'
> And they wonder why black people still voting
> 'Cause your president still choking
> Take away the football team, the basketball team
> And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
> No governor, no help from the mayor
> Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
>
> Yeah, Born right here in the USA
> But, due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee
> So accept my emotion
> Do not take it as an offensive gesture
> It's just the epitome of my soul
> And I must be me
> We got spirit y'all, we got spirit
> We got soul y'all, we got soul
> They don't want us to see, but we already know
>

Our ongoing project integrates audio, images, and digital mapping in its
analysis, in order to depict the ways that Southern Black communities
mobilize against the historical and contemporary struggles of the
[racial capitalocene](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3376-racial-capitalocene)---Françoise Vergès' critical interrogation of the so-called
Anthropocene. Vergès mobilizes Cedric Robinson's concept of racial
capitalism and its attendant challenge to the conceptions of capitalism
that ignore its originary dependence on racialization to challenge this
nascent discourse of the Anthropocene, which in broad strokes paints the
mounting ecological crisis in terms of generic, undifferentiated
humanity.[^5] While recognizing the ways that geospatial analysis and
digital tools augment and enhance historical interpretation, our ongoing
project also reckons with the inherent violence of cartography as a
practice. Sylvia Wynter explains how Western cartography developed as a
set of technologies and spatial tactics in order to facilitate Western
imperialism and its exploitative, genocidal projects.[^6]

Projecting and transforming a multilayered 3D place onto a 2D digital
map necessitates the literal and figurative flattening of that location,
producing a colonial, "bird's eye view" of a landscape. This project
deals with this contradiction by georeferencing oral history interviews,
census demographic maps, and land deeds onto all 2D maps, deepening
their historical contexts and infusing the voices of the people who
lived in these communities. In [*Black Atlas: Geography and Flow in Nineteenth-Century African American Literature*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Black-Atlas),
Judith Madera argues that "place" is a social construction that is both
discursive and affective. Further, she asserts that
"counter-cartographies," or "people's geographies," are key ways that
Black people have defined spaces for themselves and de-stabilized
dominant and exclusionary representations[^7]. Our ongoing project on
Black ecologies intervenes from this perspective, incorporating audio,
images, and digital mapping in order to create "deep maps" that garner a
robust appreciation for both Black ecological vulnerability and
possibility from the vantage of these same communities. Often prevented
from participating in the production of state recognized cartographic
and ecological knowledge due to the political economy of knowledge
production in an anti-Black world, this wide-ranging set of sources
shows the capaciousness of Black culture, thought, and social life for
producing trenchant analyses and critiques of the continuities in the
devastation and the possibilities shaping Black living. We argue that
these Black counter-cartographies are spatial tactics of resistance.
These "people's geographies" refuse statist claims of irredeemable low
income and working-class Black Southern communities that can acceptably
be allowed to face the brunt of ecological vulnerability in the United
States.

The histories and ongoing experiences of these communities require a
robust vision for environmental history, one that refuses to segregate
toxic exposure and vulnerability to climate change from the broader
political, social, and economic history of Black life and death.
Variable exposure to phenomena associated with the defilement of the
planet did not emerge with smoke stacks and automobility but rather with
the origins of the racial capitalocene in the articulation of the
plantation-industrial complex beginning in the colonization of the
Americas. Eighteenth-century planters like Landon Carter of Sabine Hall
in the Northern Neck of Virginia forced slaves to transfigure the
interface of water and land constituting the so-called "golden age" of
the Tidewater through the construction of dams, the herding of
domesticated animals at the expense of those indigenous to the region,
and the displacement of forest biodiversity through the planting of
wheat and tobacco. As Carter's diary illustrates, the effects of these
transformations as well as proximity to distant places facilitated
through transit routes along the growing Atlantic commerce set off
various dislocations and epidemics that were shaped by environmental
transformation. Carter reported chronic small-pox epidemics, flies
pestilent to wheat "said to be sent into the Country by Mr. John Tucker
of Barbadoes [sic]," rampant diarrheal diseases, and fits of ague or
malaria overtaking the enslaved as well as his biological family after
heavy downpours, likely exacerbated by deforestation. Enslaved, free,
and later post-emancipation communities suffered the effects of these
transformations as malnourished laborers forced to transform the
landscape by filling swamps, rerouting and damning waterways, herding
domesticated animals, and clearing forests.[^8] Ongoing exposure is the
legacy of these sedimented histories that form a radical and disturbing
continuity in regional and local histories of the United States South
and the wider African Diaspora.[^9]

We call for the widened yet elastic concept of "Black ecologies" as a
way of mapping ongoing susceptibility as a function of historical and
ongoing relations. Like Black geographies, the designation Black marks
the outside within the ecologies of living---the spaces that sustain and
reproduce normative forms of biological and social existence. As a
naming of the outside and the bottom, Black ecologies are foremost sites
of ongoing injury, gratuitous harm, and premature death.[^10] The
designation of these as ecologies seeks to bring into focus the critical
ways that forces above even the hand of Man punctuate, underline, and
exacerbate [raw spatial inequality](http://www.worldcat.org/title/rethinking-environmental-racism-white-privilege-and-urban-development-in-southern-california/oclc/4901047276&referer=brief_results).[^11]
Black ecologies are spaces threatened directly by the rising seas and
made toxic as the sites where the byproducts of production and
consumption can be [dumped](http://www.ucc.org/environmental-ministries_toxic-waste-20).[^12]
At the same time, they form the critical ecologies of the damned, sites
wherein ordinary Black people articulate alternative maps---dissonant
and heterodox ecological grammars as well as vision for a different
order.

Part of the methodological stakes in taking the critical knowledges
produced in Black ecologies is the imaginative engagement with heterodox
forms they take. This is evidenced in the music of New Orleans-based hip
hop and Blues artists that critiqued the state's response to Hurricane
Katrina, and the videos mapping the aftermath of violent storms in
Virginia alike. However, Black counter-cartographic knowledge has a much
longer genealogy in Black practice and thought. In her 1937 interview
with a Works Progress Administration recorder, Minnie Fulkes, a formerly
enslaved woman in Virginia recast vulnerability to violent weather as
something hopeful---as something that might not just evade but
eliminate into the stillness of death the power of white supremacy in
shaping the anti-Black landscape she understood as having originated in
slavery. After describing violence on plantations and the ongoing
economic exploitation Black people faced in the 1930s, Fulkes told her
interviewer quite candidly, "Lord, Lord, I hate white people and de
flood waters gwine drown some mo."[^13]  Here Fulkes' cartographic
knowledge of a water landscape from the bottom is recast not simply as
vulnerability but as a subtle demand on her god to eradicate the white
powerholders benefitting from the uneven contours perpetuating relations
originating in slavery through the landscape.

As political scientist Michael Hanchard posits, "Black memory is often
at odds with state memory." Examining Black ecologies draws to light the
environmental history sedimented in ongoing unequal exposure but also
reveals insurgent visions of an environmental future free of the
relations and geographies engendered by the racial capitalocene. These
visions depart from mainstream environmental discourses that privilege
conservation and preservation without critically analyzing the ways
these conceptions maintain the dominant subject-object relations of
mastery and draw directly on the history of imperial management.
Instead, they draw on a more liberatory vision for freeing the land and
the people available through our paradigm of Black ecologies.
