abstract: |
  People of black-African descent have been members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from its founding in 1830 to the present yet their names and stories have been erased from public perception on the outside and collective Latter-day Saint memory on the inside. <i>Century of Black Mormons</i> is a digital history project designed to recover what was lost, the identities of Black Latter-day Saints during the faith's first 100 years, from 1830 to 1930. This paper offers an initial interpretation of the data collected thus far. It begins to document what life was like in the pews for Black Mormons and finds that integrated worship services varied across time and space. It demonstrates that kinship networks were important to Black Mormon conversions, and that pioneering black converts presided over multi-generational families of Black Mormons whose legacies stretch into the 21st century.

In the months leading up to the 2012 presidential election between
Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, a few media outlets reinforced the public
perception that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints (commonly called Mormons) were predominantly white.[^1] Reporter
Jessica Williams from Jon Stewart's *The Daily Show* [interviewed five
Black Mormons](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/auxb75/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-the-black-mormon-vote)
and then called them "mythical creatures, the unicorns of politics." She
asked if the five whom she met comprised the entire population of Black
people in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?[^2] Susan
Saulny, a reporter for the *New York Times*, similarly speculated in a *Times* [online video](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/us/for-black-mormons-a-political-choice-like-no-other.html?_r=2&hp&) that there were only a "very small number" of Black Mormons, a "couple
of thousand max," or somewhere between "500 to 2,000."[^3] Likewise,
Jimmy Kimmel [asked on *Jimmy Kimmel Live*](http://www.sistasinzion.com/2012/10/jimmy-kimmel-doesnt-believe-there-are.html), "Are there Black Mormons? I find that hard to
believe."[^4]

[*Century of Black Mormons* (CBM)](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/welcome) is a digital history project designed
to not merely answer these questions but to historicize them.[^5] The
first documented black person to join this American born faith was
[Black Pete](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/black-pete),
a former slave who was baptized in 1830, when the fledgling movement was
less than a year old.[^6] Other Black Saints trickled in over the course
of the nineteenth century (more than 280 identified so far) and are
woven into the Mormon story. At least two black men were ordained to the
faith's highest priesthood in its first two decades, and the database
will document many more who slipped past the faith's 1907 "one drop"
policy. Yet by the beginning of the twentieth-century Mormons themselves
had erased black pioneers from their collective memory and solidified
race-based priesthood and temple restrictions in their stead.[^7] On the
inside and on the outside Black Mormons were lost to history.

*Century of Black Mormons* seeks to name, number, and identify all known
people of black-African descent baptized into the church between 1830
and 1930 and thereby recover what was lost. At its core CBM is a social
history project organized around biographies of Black Latter-day
Saints.[^8] Researchers collect primary source documents such as
baptismal records, census records, journal entries, diaries, and vital
records which are made publicly available in a digital viewer at the
bottom of each biography. A [timeline feature](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/when) (see figure 1) tracks dates of
baptism and a [map](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/where) (see figure 4) pinpoints location of baptisms. The database thus seeks to be
a principal repository for primary and secondary source information for
scholars and laypeople alike on what it meant to be black and Mormon
during the faith's pioneering century.

As scholars of religion in the United States have begun to challenge the
perception of a monolithic "Black Church," they have explored what
religious life looked like for African Americans who worshipped in
predominantly white churches, with Catholics, Congregationalists, and
Mennonites as three examples of groups that have been studied.[^9]
*Century of Black Mormons* adds a digital public history project to that
conversation as it offers an historical lens into integrated worship and
racial conversions in the Latter-day Saint tradition.[^10]

The bulk of the scholarly attention on Mormonism and race (my own
included) has focused on the white male LDS hierarchy and their
decisions over the course of the nineteenth century to restrict converts
of black-African descent from priesthood ordination and temple
worship.[^11] What that story overshadows is the fact that Mormonism has
always included baptism and confirmation for people of black-African
descent as well as integrated Sunday worship (messy though it was), from
1830 to the present.[^12] The scholarly focus on temples and priesthood
have thus obscured efforts at understanding the Mormon racial story from
the vantage point of Black Saints in the Sunday pew. Historians cannot
begin to piece together that puzzle without first documenting the
existence of Black Mormons and understanding the basic contours of their
life in the faith.

The story of race and Mormonism was shaped by the fact that the church
includes a lay priesthood of male believers and a dual worship structure
that consists of Sunday services in chapels and weekday rituals in
temples. On Sunday, parishioners partake of the sacrament of the Lord's
supper and promise to follow Jesus Christ. Additional rituals are
offered in temples on weekdays to adherents who meet specified
standards. Proxy baptisms for deceased persons, marriages (or "sealings"
for eternity), washing and anointing rituals, and a ritualized enactment
of the biblical creation narrative called the "endowment" are all
performed in temples. Membership in the faith and Sunday services have
always been open to people of all ethnic and racial backgrounds, but
white leaders eventually barred Mormons of black-African descent from
temple rituals (except for proxy baptisms) and the lay priesthood. LDS
leader Brigham Young began this form of discrimination in 1852 and
Joseph F. Smith (nephew of founding prophet Joseph Smith) solidified it
by 1908. The racial restrictions remained in force for most of the
twentieth century until then leader Spencer W. Kimball removed them in 1978. Despite such policies, CBM demonstrates that people of
black-African descent continued to join and practice the faith.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has never officially
tracked membership by race and has therefore never attempted to document
how many of its members were of black African descent. While LDS baptism
and confirmation records do not contain racial categories, those who
created those records sometimes did note race in the margins of the
documents they made. A clerk or missionary might scrawl "colored" next
to a person's name (see figures 2 and 3), a fact that highlights the way
in which white was deemed normal and a variation from white was
considered noteworthy.[^13] This is one of the ways that CBM researchers
have been able to identify individuals to include in the database along
with crowdsourcing, journals, diaries, and other records.

As of July 2019, Century of Black Mormons contained nearly seventy
individuals whose files were complete and publicly available. Their
stories and the corresponding metadata highlight two early findings.
First, integrated Sunday worship services varied across time and space
and reveal both racism in the pews as well as evidence of racial
inclusion. Second, similar to what scholars have documented about white
LDS conversions, kinship networks were important factors in the spread
of Mormonism among black converts and also influenced the
multigenerational contours of their faith.[^14]

What did Sunday worship look like for Black Latter-day Saints, given the
evolving racial policies of their church? [Jane Manning James](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/james-jane-elizabeth-manning),
one convert in 1843 remembered in an autobiography written late in life
that she joined the New Canaan Congregational Church in Wilton,
Connecticut, when she was fourteen years old but she "did not feel
satisfied." She recalled, "it seemed to me there was something more that
I was looking for." She claimed to find it eight years later when
Latter-day Saint missionaries passed through the region and baptized
her. Within a few weeks she recalled, "the Gift of Tongues came upon
me." She then experienced other spiritual manifestations that confirmed
her in her new faith. Although by the 1880s LDS leaders denied her
temple admission for the highest rituals of her faith, she did
participate in baptisms for her deceased ancestors in two LDS temples
and continued to exercise the gift of tongues, faith healings, and
testimony sharing in integrated congregations throughout her life.[^15]

William and Marie Graves were Black Saints who first encountered Mormon
missionaries street-preaching in Oakland, California. In November 1911,
the missionaries baptized and confirmed William and Marie as Latter-day
Saints. In 1920, when the couple traveled to Georgia to visit friends,
they sought out the Atlanta LDS congregation but were told that black
people were not welcome. "I never had nothing to hurt me like that in
all of my life" Marie wrote.[^16] They returned to Oakland and continued
to worship in their integrated congregation for the rest of their lives.
In fact, when William died in 1940 he left all remaining proceeds from
the settlement of his estate to his LDS congregation in Oakland. William
and Marie regularly participated in worship services in their
congregation, bearing "testimony," saying prayers, and donating money to
charitable causes.[^17]

Meanwhile in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, [Esther Jane "Nettie" Kirchhoff](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/kirchhoff-esther-jane-nettie-scott)
was a founding member of the tiny LDS branch organized there in 1904.
Her husband Richard was a German-born immigrant and Nettie was of mixed
racial ancestry. She became Sunday School Secretary in an atypical mixed
gender and mixed-race Sunday School presidency.[^18] She also taught
Sunday School, as did [Elijah Banks](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/banks-elijah),
another black convert, this time in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1899.[^19]
By all accounts, the Graves along with Elijah Banks and Nettie Kirchhoff
were valued members of integrated congregations throughout their lives.

In contrast, [Esther Jane James Leggroan](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/leggroan-esther-jane-james),
Jane Manning James's granddaughter, worshiped in the Wilford Ward in
Salt Lake City, but mostly on the margins. She felt the sting of
prejudice when fellow congregants refused to sit by her and her family.
They were accepted as members but were not encouraged or given
opportunities to fully participate.[^20] [Frances Leggroan Fleming](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/fleming-frances-leggroan)
also recounted the racism she experienced in her Salt Lake City
congregation: "I was taught you can't go into the temple, you're not the
right color. You're not good enough," she said. For a time she attended
the Methodist Church in Salt Lake City and refused to raise her
daughters as Latter-day Saints in an effort to shield them from the same
type of prejudice she had experienced. Even still, she returned to the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after her husband converted
and remained a practicing member for the rest of her life.[^21]

The difference may have been that the Graves, Kirchhoff, and Banks lived
in small and struggling congregations in locations distant from the
heart of Mormonism which needed and valued all congregants versus
Leggroan and Fleming who lived in Salt Lake City in established "wards"
or congregations which could afford to racially marginalize people and
yet still fully function. Fourteen biographies thus far offer evidence
of racial prejudice related to worship experiences.[^22] Of those
fourteen, the majority occurred in congregations in Utah. These results
may be amplified by the fact that the source base for some Utah
biographies includes oral interviews and therefore the evidence of
prejudice is more readily available than for outlying locations.
Moreover, there are exceptions to this pattern. [Paul Thomas Harris](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/harris-paul-thomas),
for example, a convert in 1910 in South Africa, encountered white
coreligionists who refused to allow Harris to worship with them
altogether. In response, missionaries administered the sacrament of the
Lord's Supper to him in his home.[^23] Similarly, in Cincinnati, Ohio,
white members made it clear to [Len](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/hope-len) and [Mary Hope](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/hope-mary-lee-pugh) that they were not welcome at Sunday services. But when the couple moved
to Salt Lake City, they worshiped in an integrated congregation.[^24] Sunday worship for Black Mormons thus varied across time and space. Lack
of sources makes it impossible to know what worship looked like in all
situations, but the database is yielding clues previously unavailable.

The database is also shedding new light on kinship conversion networks
and multigenerational families. Early converts such as free blacks [Elijah Able](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/able-elijah)
(an ordained Seventy in the priesthood) and Jane Manning James migrated
to Utah and helped to establish a pioneering black community in the
intermountain West. In 1870, [Susan Gray Reed Leggroan](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/leggroan-susan-gray-reed)
and her husband [Ned](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/leggroan-edward-ned) migrated to Utah with Ned's sister and her husband, Amanda and Samuel
Chambers, all of whom were formerly enslaved.[^25] Samuel converted in
Mississippi while enslaved and then waited until after the Civil War to
earn enough money to migrate to Utah. Amanda, Susan, and Ned joined him.
Three years after their arrival in Utah, Ned and Susan converted and
went on to preside over a multi-generational family of Black Mormons.
There are already eleven of their descendants included among the
completed profiles in the database with at least eight more family
members under research.

Elsewhere, in Tylertown, Mississippi, missionaries baptized [Samuel Magee](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/magee-samuel) in 1908. Within four months, his wife [Ardella Bickham Magee](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/magee-ardella-bickham) followed him into the faith and their children joined after that. In
total eleven members of the Magee family converted.[^26] Ardella gave
birth to her youngest son at the time of the family's conversion and she
and Samuel named their new baby [Moroni](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/magee-ernest-moroni)
after a Book of Mormon prophet.[^27] Kinship networks were clearly
important in Black Mormon conversions. Of the currently completed
profiles, seventy percent were married or related to another person who
also converted.

Many of the descendants of the pioneering black families who migrated to
Utah intermarried and formed a core group of second, third, fourth, and
fifth generation Mormons.[^28] In fact, two of Elijah Able's
great-granddaughters, ArLene and Mary June, were baptized in 1930 and
1934 respectively.[^29] Their baptisms represent four generations and
over 100 years of Ables as Latter-day Saints. Several generations of
interracial marriages also likely meant that later members of the Able
family eventually passed as white. Able's son [Moroni](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/able-moroni) and grandson [Elijah R. Ables](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/century-of-black-mormons/page/ables-elijah-r),
although identified in some census records as black and mulatto, were
both ordained Elders in the LDS lay priesthood in 1871 and 1935
respectively, marking at least three black priesthood holders in the
same family.[^30] Jane Manning James's children were also baptized but
most left Mormonism before they died, likely in response to the
shrinking space for full black participation in their chosen faith.[^31]
Even still, *Century of Black Mormons* already includes fourth and fifth
generation descendants of James and her husband Isaac, a fact that
should prompt new understandings of Mormonism's racial story across
generations.[^32] Rather than one or two notable Black Latter-day Saints
as the focus of the Black Mormon story, *Century of Black Mormons* has
documented a number of pioneering black families whose legacies endured
for more than a century.

In fact, the map feature in *Century of Black Mormons* (see figure 4) has already
revealed an interesting pattern of conversion, especially when combined
with the database's timeline. Second, third, fourth, and fifth
generation Mormons represent a growing number of Utah based baptisms and
so far account for all of the baptisms between 1873 and 1891 (see figure
5). Of the twenty-one Utah baptisms thus far, sixty-five percent were of
people who were second generation or later Mormons. As Mormonism
reinvigorated its missionary program by the 1890s in the wake of a
federal anti-polygamy crackdown, baptisms outside of Utah followed
through the 1930s.

{% figure caption: "Figure 5. Baptismal Locations in Comparison. Those “Baptized in U.S.” include all people baptized in the United States, excluding those baptized in Utah. Of the Utah baptisms, sixty-five percent were second, third, fourth, and fifth generation Black Mormons. The international baptisms include people baptized in South Africa, England, and three sailors baptized on board an LDS immigrant ship somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean." %}

{% endfigure %}

In sum, Century of Black Mormons is yielding new clues about the
contours of integrated Sunday worship among Latter-day Saints with
evidence of both the challenges and promises of racial integration. The
project further illustrates the significance of kinship conversion
networks among Black Mormons with an overwhelming majority of people in
the database married or related to someone else who was baptized. Those
networks likely made it easier to pass on the faith, with some Black
Mormon families extending over five generations. Clearly, there are
Black Mormons and there always have been too. Their lives add complexity
to a largely white Mormon narrative and teach new lessons about the
intersections between race, region, and religion in American history.

### Notes

[^1]: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the official name of the church. Its adherents are sometimes referred to as Mormons, a nicknamed derived from the Book of Mormon, a book accepted as scripture by members of the faith. Members are also sometimes called Latter-day Saints, LDS, or Saints, (a term used to mean a follower of Jesus Christ, not to indicate a holy status as in the Catholic tradition). Mormon, Latter-day Saint, and Saint are used interchangeably in this essay. 

[^2]: Williams, “Black Mormon Vote.”

[^3]: Saulny, “Black Mormons.” See the embedded video “TimesCast Politics: Black Mormons.”

[^4]: Sistas in Zion, “Jimmy Kimmel.”

[^5]: A July 24, 2009 Pew Research Center survey, “[A Portrait of Mormons in the U.S.](https://www.pewforum.org/2009/07/24/a-portrait-of-mormons-in-the-us/#3)” found that between one and three percent of U.S. Mormons were black (60,000 to 180,000 members). Dr. Jacob Rugh at Brigham Young University estimates that in 2018 there were one million black Latter-day Saints globally. 

[^6]: McBride, “Black Pete.” See also Staker, *Hearken, O Ye People*, 1--8, 64--65.

[^7]: For a history of this process in context see Reeve, *Religion of a Different Color*.

[^8]: Century of Black Mormons traces thirteen metadata categories in each biography: name, gender, birthdate, birth place, death date, death place, residences (to track mobility over time), baptism, confirmation, faith transition (if a person transitioned to a different faith after joining Mormonism), priesthood (if a man was ordained to the lay LDS priesthood before 1978), and temple (if a man or woman received temple rituals before 1978).

[^9]: See Bailey, *Down in the Valley* and Glaude, *African American Religion* for studies that complicate notions of a monolithic “black church.” See Cressler, *Authentically Black*; Boles, “Dividing the Faith”; Boles, “African American Experiences,” 310--323; Johnson, “Healing the Mystical Body”; and Shearer, “‘Buttcheek to Buttcheek’” for studies that examine racial integration in predominantly white churches.

[^10]: Scholars of Protestantism meanwhile continue to note that “the old adage about eleven o’clock Sunday morning being the most segregated hour in the United States remains true.” See Hawkins and Sinitiere, *Christians and the Color Line*, 2; and Emerson and Smith, *Divided by Faith*. The publication of Divided by Faith highlighted the ways in which evangelical Christianity “actually exacerbated” racial divisions in the United States rather than acting to overcome them.

[^11]: See Reeve, *Religion of a Different Color*; Bringhurst, *Saints, Slaves, & Blacks*; Stevenson, *For the Cause of Righteousness*; Harris and Bringhurst, *The Mormon Church and Blacks*;  Mauss, *All Abraham’s Children*; and Mueller, *Race and the Making of the Mormon People*. There are exceptions which tend to focus on the two most well documented black Latter-day Saints, Jane Manning James and Elijah Able. See for example, Newell, *Your Sister in the Gospel*; Newell, “What Jane James Saw”; Newell, “Autobiography and Interview,” 251--91; Coleman, “‘Is There No Blessing for Me?’”; Stevenson, “‘A Negro Preacher’”; Stevenson, *Black Mormon*; and Jackson, *Elijah Abel*.

[^12]: For scholarship which examines black LDS worship see Driggs, “’How Do Things Look on the Ground?"; Embry, “Speaking for Themselves,” 99--110; Embry, *Black Saints*; and Strickling, *On Fire in Baltimore*.

[^13]: Not all membership records in the database contain such notations and as a result whatever the total number of black Latter-day Saints we ultimately count in the database (expectations are somewhere between 300 and 400) it will automatically be an underrepresentation.

[^14]: On conversion networks see Stark and Finke, *Acts of Faith*, chapter 5; Allison, “Layered Lives,” 168--213; and Rust, *Radical Origins*.

[^15]: Newell, *Your Sister in the Gospel*; Newell, “Autobiography and Interview,” 251--291. See also Newell, “Jane Elizabeth Manning James.”
