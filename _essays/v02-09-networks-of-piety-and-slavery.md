  The first Catholic Bible published in the United States in 1790 contained a subscriber list: names and locations of people, mostly Catholics, who helped finance the publication. An initial map of these 429 names, created for a 2017 exhibition in the University of Notre Dame's Rare Books and Special Collections, showed clusters of subscribers in Maryland and Pennsylvania. The largest subset identified so far (102 subscribers) was in rural Maryland, and is this paper's focus. Digital tools helped us visualize networks within this community, including historical connections between slavery and piety. We found that a large majority of Maryland Catholics who purchased Bibles were also slaveholders (more than twice the average rate of slaveholding in the South). The densest subscriber locations also trace a discernable path along the pattern of Jesuit plantations in southern and eastern Maryland, a parallel between piety and slaveholding the map made visible. Digital mapping also pulled into focus connections among rural Catholics, and relationships between them and the people they enslaved. Archival records revealed dense kinship, religious, and fraternal relationships among subscribers. Records uncovered enslaved Marylanders who embraced Catholicism, sued or petitioned for freedom, or fled. Slavery and religion formed connective tissue in post-Revolutionary Maryland.

When Edward Queen sued his Jesuit enslaver Rev. John Ashton for freedom
in 1791, a fellow priest, the Rev. Thomas Digges from the nearby town of
Melwood, Maryland, served as a witness.[^1] Queen argued that he and his
family were descendants of a free woman of color and should have never
been enslaved. Queen family members, enslaved by Ashton at his White
Marsh plantation, represented almost a third of the priest's unfree
labor force. After a three-year legal fight, Edward Queen won
manumission for himself and his family in 1794.

Their victory set an example for other men and women enslaved by
Maryland Catholics. On occasion, a single successful manumission suit
resulted in other enslavers granting freedom to people distantly related
to the plaintiff. Charles Carroll of Carrollton, Maryland, the only
Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence, voluntarily freed 23
people after yet another man, Charles Mahoney, won his suit against John
Ashton in the mid-1790s.[^2] Religious networks, as well as economic and
legal ones, formed ties among Maryland Catholics in post-Revolutionary
Maryland.

One such network appears in the historical record in the form of a list.
Philadelphia printer Mathew Carey published the first Catholic Bible in
the United States in 1790. To finance the project's significant costs he
solicited deposits from purchasers (he called them subscribers) and
printed the names of 429 of them in the opening pages of the
publication. Taking Carey's subscriber list as the starting point, [this project](https://nd-cds.shinyapps.io/BadinApp/?display=LocationAccuracy) visualizes connections between religious identity, practice, and slavery among a subset of 102 subscribers who lived in rural Maryland (see figure 1).[^3] We focused on rural Marylanders
because they made up the single largest group of subscribers identified
thus far. The second largest group was 100 subscribers from
Philadelphia, which will be the focus of future work.[^4] Our findings
are preliminary, as some subscribers do not appear in census or archival
records and remain unverified.

Several patterns stand out in both the general numbers and the more
specific networks we have uncovered. First, these Bible purchasers
enslaved people at more than twice the average rate for the South. This
small dataset of wealthy, pious Catholics does not represent white
Catholics in general, but it shows that a large majority of wealthy
Maryland Catholics who purchased Bibles were also slaveholders. This
correlation between Catholic identity, practice, and enslaving supports
historian Maura Farrelly's argument that holding people in racialized
slavery made democratic republicanism an acceptably safe political
system for white Maryland Catholics, who otherwise feared social and
political disruptions in post-Revolutionary America.[^5] Second, the
process of identifying subscribers affords a fine-grained look at this
very small community of American Catholics and their social and economic
networks. It pulls into focus connections among rural Maryland
Catholics, as well as relationships between them and the people they
enslaved. Slavery touched every Catholic institution and network in
Maryland in this period. These connections provide a micro-history level
view of conflicts over freedom and slavery that suggest the existence of
differing opinions about slavery among enslavers, while also offering a
limited view of some of the enslaved people\'s lives.

Using archival databases, census records, and historical newspapers, we
were able to confirm that of the 102 rural Maryland subscribers, 72 held
people in slavery (71%). Although the exact number of enslavers in
Maryland during this period has not been identified, about one-third of
all white Southern families claimed people as property during the first
half of the nineteenth century.[^6] This very high rate among rural
Catholic Bible subscribers (more than double the regional rate) does not
indicate that Catholics in general held people in slavery at more than
twice the rate of their non-Catholic neighbors; the price of the Bible
ensures that this was a self-selected group of Catholics who were
wealthy as well as pious. But it allows us to conclude that a large
majority of these well-to-do and devout people were enslavers. Of these
72 enslavers, 64 were laypeople, eight were priests, and three were
women. Altogether, they held 2,422 people in slavery (see figure 1).
Just eight enslavers claimed as property nearly half of the enslaved
people in this group: 1,171 enslaved (48%). Thirty-eight other
subscribers held 10 or more people in slavery, and 20 enslaved fewer
than 10 people. For six enslavers, we have not been able to identify the
precise number of people they held in slavery.

{% figure caption: "Figure 2. Total number of enslaved people held by 66 Catholic Bible subscribers in our sample, grouped together by the size of the slaveholders' households/plantations.

{% endfigure %}

An [initial impression](https://nd-cds.shinyapps.io/BadinApp/) of the
subscribers who held the largest number of people in slavery shows a
pattern of large plantations in Prince George's and Frederick counties,
in the north and west region of Maryland. The [Location Accuracy display](https://nd-cds.shinyapps.io/BadinApp/?display=LocationAccuracy),
however, shows two dominant clusters of subscribers who enslaved: a
discernable corridor of plantations in southern Maryland (from the
southern tip of St. Mary's County through Charles and St. George's
counties, up into Georgetown) and on the Eastern Shore, especially in
Queen Anne and Talbot counties. In the southern Maryland cluster, 42 of
51 subscribers claimed people as property. For the 36 whose plantation
records survive, the majority (20) held more than 22 people in
slavery---a massing of wealth that placed these Bible subscribers in the
elite planter class.[^7] The other 16 subscribers held between 7 and 22
people in slavery. On the Eastern Shore, 18 out of 22 subscribers
enslaved others, but only seven held more than 22 people in slavery. The
majority (11) claimed 13 or fewer people as property.

The two clusters reflect what historians of elites and slavery in
Maryland have established: these were areas of intense agricultural
production in which a network of well-connected, elite planters defined
slavery in the region.[^8] Southern Maryland remained a
tobacco-producing area; growing tobacco demanded year-round labor.
Landowners on the Eastern Shore, however, had turned from tobacco to
cereals (most commonly wheat) even before the Revolution. Wheat required
seasonal labor, which decreased the economic incentive to hold large
numbers of people in slavery.[^9]

The clustering pattern of Bible subscribers who were also enslavers,
however, suggests more than production and status formation at play. As
the [Jesuit Plantation Project](http://jesuitplantationproject.org/s/jpp/page/welcome) shows, Catholic clergy had established Jesuit communities that were dependent on the labor of enslaved people, from the southern tip of St. Mary's County through Charles County and
extending to White Marsh Plantation northeast of Georgetown, and on the
Eastern Shore.[^10] The density of lay Bible subscribers in these same
areas follows this pattern of Catholic clerical establishment as well as
the priests' unfree labor practices. Out of 51 subscribers in southern
Maryland, six were clerics who, as we have confirmed, enslaved at least
202 people among them. On the Eastern Shore, we have identified just two
clerical subscribers, who, between them, enslaved 60 people.

While Jesuit establishment helps to explain the two most prominent
clusters of Bible subscribers, our project also shows that Catholic
settlement and enslaving extended across Maryland, through the northern
and western parts of the state. Late eighteenth and early
nineteenth-century records (wills, probate lists, parish records, and
newspaper ads) reveal dense kinship, religious, and fraternal
relationships among these subscribers. As mentioned above, for example,
Charles Carroll, whose main residence was in Frederick, tracked the
outcomes of protracted suits and made manumission decisions based on
them. Many of these demonstrably pious laymen had close ties with
Catholic religious, either through kinship, friendship, patronage, or
philanthropy. For example, Nottley Young was one of the richest men in
Maryland in 1790, with a large estate on the Potomac and 265 enslaved
people. He was a close friend to fellow subscribers Rev. John Ashton and
George Digges of Warburton. Both Ashton and Digges bequeathed Young land
or property in their wills. One notable professional network among the
clerical subscribers was their connection to the school at Georgetown
(now Georgetown University). Of the 13 Maryland priest subscribers
(including Bishop John Carroll, himself an enslaver), seven had ties to
Georgetown.

The Jesuit Plantation Project focuses on the lives of people enslaved by
Maryland Jesuits. We have tracked the lives of people enslaved by
Maryland Bible subscribers. Enslaved people appear in surviving archives
as runaways, as legal petitioners, as parties in suits for freedom, and
as co-religionists. White Maryland Catholics may have defined their
republicanism by holding others in slavery; if so, enslaved Marylanders
rejected that alignment. We have identified 302 enslaved people
connected to Bible subscribers by name in records dated from 1772
through 1819. The bulk of the records (185 of 302) were made in the two
decades surrounding the Bible's publication (1780 to 1800). They show
that 22 people ran away and 20 petitioned or sued for their freedom. Of
those who used the courts, 14 were freed by petition and two by
lawsuits. Records also reveal that some Marylanders held in slavery
embraced Catholicism. They were married by priests and stood as sponsors
for children at their baptisms. One woman, Rebecca (no surname), served
as a baptismal sponsor for a decade at Trinity Church in Georgetown, the
site of Bishop of Baltimore John Carroll's new college.[^11]

Archival research has uncovered many hidden stories about the lives
represented by data points on a map of Catholic Bible subscribers, which
was where this project began.[^12] From bishops to signers of the
founding documents of the nation and from freed people to those whose
names we will never recover, this project visualizes how slavery and
religion operated as connective tissue in post-Revolutionary Maryland.

This visualization emerged out of an exhibition, “‘Preserving the Steadfastness of Your Faith’: Catholics in the Early American Republic,” displayed in Rare Books and Special Collections, Hesburgh Libraries, the University of Notre Dame, in 2017. Bohlmann and GIS librarian Matthew Sisk plotted all identified locations of 429 subscribers in the Douai-Rheims Bible published by Carey in 1790. The publication cost six Spanish silver dollars (about $150 today). For the list of rural Maryland subscribers, see the "Subscribers Data" tab in the Shiny app.

[^4]: We excluded Baltimore subscribers in this study. The intention of the larger project, of which this is only a first step, is to examine urban subscribers separately. Philadelphia is the largest urban cluster, with 100 subscribers identified so far. Baltimore is the next largest urban group with between 26 and 50 (depending on how many were city or county). More research was necessary to identify these subscribers, which was beyond the scope of this segment of the project.

[^5]: Farrelly argues that after the Revolution slavery “made republicanism and individual freedom ‘safe’ for eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Catholics”; a racialized republicanism. See Farrelly, “American Slavery,” 76--77, 85. Murphy also argues that in the colonial period, Maryland Jesuits enslaved others as a way of asserting their status as Englishmen among their fellow colonists, and to defend the Jesuits’ own religious freedoms.
