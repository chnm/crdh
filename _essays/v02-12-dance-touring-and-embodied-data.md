  This article represents the first stage of a larger research project that considers the kinds of questions and problems that make the analysis and visualization of data meaningful for the study of dance in a historical context. We pursue this work through the exemplary case study of mid-century African American choreographer Katherine Dunham and the global legacy of her international touring. In this short piece, we focus on a dataset we manually curated to document Dunham’s location nearly every day for the four years between January 1st, 1950 and December 31st, 1953. We use this daily itinerary to consider patterns of her travel and their implications, engaging with dance both as a mode of thinking about archives of moving bodies, and as an object of historical study.

How dance circulates transnationally is an important question for dance
studies right now, and we ask how digital methods can extend this
inquiry. This article represents the first stage of a larger research project that considers the kinds of questions and problems that make the analysis and visualization of data meaningful for the study of dance in a historical context. We pursue this work through the exemplary case study of Katherine Dunham
and her global legacy. A prolific twentieth century dance artist, Dunham
choreographed and performed in operas, nightclubs, Broadway shows,
Hollywood films, and modern concert dance. Over a career that spanned
eighty years, Dunham worked across five continents in many contexts,
from her early anthropological research in Haiti to her curatorial,
pedagogical, activist, and administrative projects later in Dakar, New
York, and East St. Louis. Dancers around the world today continue to
cite her as an influence and inspiration.[^1]

In this short piece, we focus specifically on a dataset we manually
curated to document Dunham's location nearly every day for the four
years between January 1st, 1950 and December 31st, 1953. As part of a
critical mixed methods approach, this dataset helps us to think about
embodied, transnational labor in Dunham's everyday practices of
making-do as an African American female artist in the mid-twentieth
century. First, we describe the curation of the dataset itself. Then, we
turn to two points of entry that digital visualization and data analysis
provide: patterns of travel that correlate with financial support, and
the corporeal wear and tear produced by what we have elsewhere called
"movement on the move."[^2] In this essay---and in
our [*Dunham's Data*](http://www.dunhamsdata.org) research as a whole---we follow imperatives to
bring embodiment in digital research in a literal way, seeking to use our training as dance scholars in
order to access the lived, bodily experiences that both underpin and
haunt such data.[^3]

We manually assembled the bulk of this dataset from Dunham's personal
and professional correspondence, contracts, receipt books, personal
logs, programs, and newspaper clippings. Although Dunham was a rigorous
self-archivist, no single document reliably indicates where she was at a
given moment, and we routinely cross-reference and reconcile multiple
data points to achieve as rigorous an itinerary as possible. Because she
travelled so much, her correspondence was often sent or received "in
care of" and postcards from one town were postmarked in another city.
Similarly, advertisements and previews in newspapers give a limited view
of her stays since her contracts lengthened or shortened in relation to
the financial success of her shows. We supplemented Dunham's archives
with additional documents, including immigration records, local
newspapers, and historical transit maps and schedules. For the four-year
period 1950--53, we have identified with a reasonable level of confidence
the cities and countries where Dunham began and ended 93% of her days---1359 out of 1461 days. We are currently expanding this dataset to cover over thirty years of her performing career.

What constitutes data is already an interpretation that is further
processed through acts of collection and display---an idea that
Johanna Drucker has described as "capta" to acknowledge "the situated,
partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production."[^4] For example, we arrived at the four-year itinerary through aprocess of inference and deduction that also negotiated more fuzzy
meanings. When such datasets power visualizations to give us greater
purchase on Dunham's touring and performance schedule as a whole, the
point is not to create something that might appear to be "natural
representations of pre-existing fact," but to lead with dance-based and humanistic values.[^5] For us, this means substantiating bodily experience and making the work of performance
visible---from time spent in rehearsal to the labor of travel. This is a
critical reminder for all data, and especially for that which seeks to
represent black embodiment and experiences while resisting the
"devastating thingification of black women, children, and men" that is
entangled with histories of quantification from the slave trade onwards.[^6]

A precise cataloguing of travel is particularly important for a
choreographer whose artistic practice is uniquely informed by real and
imagined engagements with geographic locations---what has been called
Dunham's "diasporic imagination."[^7] Although scholars have
tracked Dunham's extensive travels on an ad hoc basis, *Dunham's Data*
represents the first attempt to build a comprehensive dataset of her
whereabouts, a project that can not only serve as a reference but also
spur further scholarship. We initially began to build this dataset to
understand the relationship between Dunham's choreographic and
ethnographic work by analyzing the ways her dances both drew on place
and circulated these images, movements, and sounds to other places---a
set of questions that we are still pursuing. In the process, however, we
realized how much information was already contained in this reference
dataset, which demanded a kind of everyday analytic to grapple with the
way a granular view, in turn, lends itself to understanding the politics
of lived experience. In a longer essay, we articulate this "politics of
the everyday" in terms of Katherine McKittrick's theorization of the
stakes of making visible the ways in which black women's geographies of
the everyday are lived.[^8] As dance scholars, we are also interested in the implications
of such a scalable analytic for dance history.

<figcaption>Figure 1. Spatialized sequence of Dunham's 1950-53 destinations. The timeline is sequential from the basemap upwards, beginning with 1950 closest to the map and ending with the last day of 1953 at the top of the image. Vertical extrusions of dots represent lengths of stay in a given location, while vertical lines connect each stay to a city on the map below. From this video, we can see both the geographical reach of Dunham's travels over these four years, encompassing locations in Europe, North and South America, Africa, and the Caribbean, as well as how cities are connected by Dunham's movement through them.

Above is a video flythrough of this dataset plotted in a space-time
aquarium using ArcGIS that allows us to show the geographic dimensions
of where Dunham traveled over the course of four years while retaining
the sequence of her visits. Each day for which we have location data is
represented by a dot, although these become compressed when viewing the
map at a distance. Looking day by day foregrounds the amount of work and
travel Dunham is doing---both with and without her company---and the
physical and emotional toll that such work implies. It produces a
visceral effect to look at a map like this with the knowledge that
Dunham is performing or rehearsing for at least 72% of the days in this
four-year period, not counting the professional networking, writing, or
researching local dance cultures that were also part of her overall
workload.

This space-time aquarium clearly shows the places where Dunham had
lengthy stays and the places to which she returned.[^9] Because Dunham had no lasting public or private
sponsorship, her touring pathways and the duration of her stays offer
insight into solvency and the overall support available to sustain her
ongoing work. As a result, locations become meaningful, with those where
she lingered signifying financial success (or sometimes layoff periods
as well). Returning to a place may further indicate expectations of
repeat successes or point to investments of an affective rather than
financial variety, as we see, for example, with Haiti. There is a
tension here in the idea of support; at the same time that constant
travel demonstrates an international interest in and audience for
Dunham's work, it is also a difficult means of artistic survival. Figure
2 visualizes Dunham's stays and returns with a timeline that enables us
to examine shifting sites of support in terms of their change over time.
It facilitates comparisons across cities by compressing a large span of
time and global travel into a visually comprehensible chart.

{% endfigure %}

Looking at figures 1 and 2, we see that Dunham's patterns of travel
change over these four years. Scholarship on Dunham tends to focus on
three key cities: Paris, Port-au-Prince, and New York City, all of which
appear in the top seven cities of Figure 2. However, this dataset allows
us to trace the many other cities that comprise Dunham's international
circulation, and to observe her increasing precarity as stay-lengths
shorten from late 1952 to mid-1953. We also see the proportion of
nightclub work on the West Coast of the United States, the significance
of which Dunham scholarship has not yet addressed. During this period,
Dunham visited the Los Angeles area six times for a cumulative total of
119 days. (In fact, the only place where Dunham spent more time overall
than Los Angeles was Paris---180 days over seven visits). She spent
almost that number of days again in other parts of the western US and
Canada, including Las Vegas, Reno, San Francisco, Crystal Bay, and
Vancouver. Analyzing the geographic distributions of financial and
affective support in terms of her stays and returns, we are able to
better assess changes in Dunham's patterns of travel and what they
prompt for further inquiry---from examining cities that have
previously been overlooked but which supported Dunham's global reach, to
the politics that are surfaced in her daily practices of making do. The
substantial amount of nightclub work further illuminates a lacuna in
dance history, which has tended to overlook the importance of
non-concert venues; this is something we seek to address.

Visualizations such as these can obscure the labor of performing bodies
traveling between cities and performing in them. Yet, exploring these
patterns as they emerge day by day not only reveals some of the
strategies that Dunham used to adapt and keep going, but also gestures
to the wear and tear of being on the road. We have already mentioned
time spent in rehearsal and performance, but travel itself imposes
further stressors. Across the 1359 days that we tracked, we have
identified 110 distinct trips. A statistical analysis of stay
distribution reveals a median duration of five nights (Figure 3), with
most stays lasting between one day and two weeks. In other words, we are
talking about almost constant travel, and this four-year period is not
an anomaly. It is, rather, the pattern we are beginning to discover
across many decades of Dunham's career. This has enormous implications
for considering wellbeing as embodied experience in relation to crafting
a transnational life in performance.[^10]

{% figure caption: "Figure 3. Frequency of nights stayed, 1950--53. This box plot visualizes
the distribution of Dunham's stay lengths. The normal distribution is 1
to 14 nights, with a maximum normal value of 30 nights. Longer stays are
outliers. The median distribution is a stay of 5 nights, with 31% of her
stays lasting a single night. Data: Harmony Bench and Kate Elswit;

The dataset and three visualizations depicted in this short essay engage
with dance both as a mode of thinking about archives of moving bodies,
and as an object of historical study. Dunham scholars already understand
the mid-1930s to late-1960s to be one of extensive international travel
for Dunham, but our expanding dataset is beginning to show the punishing
pace of her touring and indicate the presence and absence of sustaining
support structures. We are currently in the final stages of building out
this daily itinerary to encompass 1947--60, with the goal of ultimately
representing the full thirty-year period. The daily itinerary dataset
stands at the core of a host of further inquiries on which we are
embarking, from the relationship between choreography and ethnography in
Dunham's work, to the trajectories of the hundreds of performers who
traveled alongside her.[^11] This labor-intensive
work already seeds a foundational argument for the combination of dance
history and digital methods: that any kind of transnational analysis in
dance requires a granular understanding of travel and lived experience
at the scale of the everyday that makes visible when, where, and what we
mean when we say "transnational." Even with our critical mixed methods
approach, however, the data does not stand on its own; rather, we must
constantly return to "flesh out" this data by considering it alongside
the archival artifacts and lived histories from which it was derived. As
we continue these explorations, we also push further into the difficulty
of rendering fleshy, bodily experience through graphical representation.[^12] Amplifying the materiality of bodies in and through digital representations is what is at stake in bringing dance
history and digital humanities into deeper conversation.
