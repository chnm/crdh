abstract: |
  Lynching inventories are fundamental tools to measure the extent and trends of lethal mob violence against alleged criminals during the post-Reconstruction era in the United States. The digital history project "Racial Terror: Lynchings in Virginia, 1877-1927" revisits the Beck-Tolnay inventory of Southern lynchings, the most comprehensive and accurate scholarly catalogue of lethal mob violence in the Deep South. Focusing on lynching in Virginia, this project uses local, rather than national, newspapers as its main source of information. Importantly, the use of local sources reveals that <i>white</i> victims of lynching in Virginia have been overcounted in lynching inventories. This is a significant finding because lynching apologists often used white lynching victims to defend lethal mob violence arguing that, rather than a tool of white domination, lynching was a legitimate and non-racialized form of "popular justice" against hideous crimes. This project enhances our understanding of lynching as a form of racialized terrorism and recommends the systematic use of local newspapers and sources to correct existing lynching catalogues.

Lynching inventories are key instruments to gauge the extent of
racialized terrorism against African Americans during the
post-Reconstruction era in the US South. As Ida B. Wells famously wrote,
lynching was not "the creature of an hour, the sudden outburst of
uncontrolled fury, or the unspeakable brutality of an insane mob."[^1]
Instead, lynching was a formidable institution to preserve white
supremacy in the Jim Crow South through the systematic use of racial
terror. While a small number of lynching victims were white, lynching
was a form of state-sanctioned terrorism against African Americans
throughout the South.[^2] Some lynch mobs operated in disguise, while
many others did not bother to conceal their identities. Prominent
citizens, and even local authorities, often participated in the macabre
ritual of killing alleged criminals in the name of "justice," race, or
tradition. Very few lynchers ever faced trial, and even fewer were
indicted for their crimes. The expectation of impunity for this kind of
extralegal violence underscores the complicity of local, state and
federal authorities in perpetuating a state of racial terror for African
Americans during Jim Crow.

The digital history project [*Racial Terror: Lynchings in Virginia, 1877--1927*](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/) compiles an
amended and enhanced inventory of lethal mob violence in Virginia.
Starting from the Beck-Tolnay[^3] inventory of Southern lynchings, this
project, for the first time, uses local Virginia newspapers rather than
national newspapers, as its main source of information. Critically, this
project unveils how white victims of lynching in Virginia have been
overcounted in the past. This is an important finding because lynching
apologists in the South (and sometimes in the North) often used white
lynching victims to defend lethal mob violence. Rather than a tool of
white domination, apologists would argue, lynching was a legitimate and
non-racialized enforcement of "popular justice" against hideous crimes.
The overestimation of white lynching victims further reinforces our
understanding of the lynching era as one of racialized terror. Local
newspapers and archives are vital sources to correct existing
catalogues.

### Lynching Definition and Catalogues

To understand the pervasiveness of
lynching in the South, it is essential to measure how many lynchings
took place and who were the victims of lethal mob violence. A shared
definition of what constitutes a lynching is necessary to provide a
consistent measurement of racial terror in the South. It was only in
1940 that a consensus definition was reached at a NAACP meeting at the
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama with other anti-lynching organizations.
According to this definition, lynching involves the extra-legal killing
of a person by a group of at least three people acting under the pretext
of service to justice or tradition.[^4] While this definition has its
limitations,[^5] scholars widely accept it and have adopted it for
research purposes.

Historically, three primary sources have been used to count lynching:
(1) the Tuskegee Institute's national inventory of more than 4,700
lynchings between 1882 and 1964; (2) the NAACP database, covering the
years from 1889 to the 1950s; and (3) the *Chicago Tribune*'s yearly
recording of lynching victims between 1882 and 1918.[^6] All of these
sources contain several errors and tend to be inconsistent, often
leading contemporary scholars to compile their own inventories that
focus on different geographical areas and historical periods.[^7] These
updated inventories are used to assess the extent, causes, and
consequences of lethal mob violence in the United States. In addition to
supplying critical information about the circumstances surrounding
lynchings, catalogues allow the computation of temporal patterns and the
geographical distribution of lethal mob violence.

The most comprehensive effort to document lynchings in the US South is
the Beck-Tolnay inventory, available at the [CSDE Lynching Database](http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/home)
website, covering 1882--1930. Starting from the three historical
inventories (Tuskegee, NAACP, and *Chicago Tribune*), Beck and Tolnay
verified each reported lynching for ten Southern states (Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee), using a mix of national and
local newspapers as their main source of information.[^8] They also
conducted additional newspaper research to identify other lynching
cases. More recently, Beck expanded the database by identifying victims
of mob violence in Virginia and West Virginia.

The *Racial Terror* project revisits and complements the Beck-Tolnay
inventory of Virginia lynchings by using local Virginia historical
newspapers, rather than national ones. Typically, researchers have
relied on national newspapers to compile lynching databases;[^9]
however, local newspapers often reported more detailed accounts of
lynching, due to their geographical proximity to the events and easier
access to local sources. Local newspapers also were more likely to
follow up on local stories and cover the aftermath of a lynching.

### Racial Terror Project

In the spring of 2017, I led a research team of
six senior students enrolled in an advanced research course at James
Madison University. Their semester-long task was to verify each Virginia
lynching victim contained in the Beck-Tolnay database. Relying on the
[Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/)
website, students searched, catalogued and compiled a database of
historical Virginia newspapers.[^10] In early 2018, the database was
made publicly available through the [*Racial Terror: Lynching in Virginia, 1877--1927*](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/)
website. This site tells the stories of the 104 known Virginia lynching
victims between the end of Reconstruction and the introduction of the
Virginia Anti-lynching Law in 1928.[^11] Thanks to this original
research on local newspapers, the website provides a revised and more
detailed catalogue of Virginia lynchings, adding information on the age
and the occupation of each lynching victim, as well as more precise
geographical information (town/city) regarding the location of the
lynching, whenever available. Furthermore, local newspapers helped to
identify one previously unnamed lynching victim.[^12]

The unique advantage of using a digital history project to revise the
lynching database lies in its openness, iterative nature and
replicability.[^13] As more historical newspapers are digitized, the
inventory gets periodically updated and expanded. Website users
routinely comment on the project, provide feedback and submit additional
information to enrich the website, or correct errors.[^14] In addition
to its research objective, this digital project also includes civic and
pedagogical aspirations; in particular, it strives to help restore the
collective memory of lynching victims, too often erased from local
histories. Thus, for each [lynching victim](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/victims/), the
*Racial Terror* website dedicates a page detailing the events leading to
their killing and what happened afterwards; it also displays all the
primary sources (local newspapers) used to reconstruct that story.
Making this material available online invites local communities and
activists to conduct their own research and engage with the history of
racial terror in their localities. An interactive [map](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/map/) of Virginia (see figure 1) visually displays where each lynching occurred.

</figure>

The website also provides a searchable [database](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/articles/) of
more than 500 historical Virginia newspaper articles on lynching. The
articles are drawn from 36 local newspapers (except for three articles
coming from *The Washington Post* and one from the *New York
Tribune*).[^15] The [*Alexandria Gazette*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85025007/)
is the newspaper with the largest number of articles (99), followed by
the [*Richmond Dispatch*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038614/)
(84) and [*The Richmond Times*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85034438/)
(55). Almost all of the news articles come from white mainstream
newspapers, with the important exception of 53 articles from the
[*Richmond Planet*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84025841/),
one of the most vociferous anti-lynching black newspapers.[^16]

### Local Newspapers and Overcounting Lynching Victims 

The main methodological innovation of this project lies in the use of local
Virginia newspapers to verify the existing inventory and collect
additional information about the events preceding the killing, as well
as its aftermath. Local newspapers in the late 1800s and early 1900s
usually covered one or two counties and targeted a localized audience
with a preponderance of local stories over state-wide and national ones.
Local newspapers in large cities, like Richmond, had a more regional
appeal and wider readership, but they still retained a keen interest in
reporting about important local stories like lynching. These newspapers
would often reprint dispatches from local outlets about mob violence and
were also more likely than national newspapers to cover the
legal/political consequences of a local lynching.

Local newspapers can thus improve existing lynching inventories, which
are based mainly on national newspapers that typically underestimate
lethal mob violence.[^17] Lynchings reported locally, for instance, may
not have been picked up by a national news service, or larger regional
newspapers.[^18] If that is the case, a lynching would not appear in the
inventory. Searching for unreported lynchings is a key challenge for
scholars and activists, and historiography has extensively examined the
issue of undercounting lynching victims.[^19]

Rarely discussed, however, is the issue of overcounting, that is "the
reporting of events that were not really lynchings."[^20] Tolnay and
Beck warned that the "problem of overcounting in previous lynching
inventories is as potentially serious as that of undercounting."
Overcounting can be ascribed to the reliance on national newspapers, as
well as activist groups' advocacy against lynching. For instance, Cook
claims that the NAACP probably overcounted (black) lynching victims to
dramatize the atrocity of mob violence.[^21] Noticing that the NAACP
overcounted lynching victims in the Mid-Atlantic, Barrow instead
attributed this over-reporting to the NAACP's reliance on national
newspapers.[^22] This project expands this under-researched
historiography by confirming that overcounting is indeed as much of a
problem as undercounting. Remarkably though, overcounting concerned only
white victims in Virginia, raising several questions as to how to
interpret and correct current lynching inventories.

The Beck-Tolnay inventory identified 109 lynching victims in Virginia
between 1877 and 1927. Eighty-three victims were black (76% of the total
number of victims), one of them, [Charlotte Harris](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1878030601/), a woman; the remaining 26 victims were white (24%), one of them, [Peb Falls](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1897092501/), a
woman. Researching local Virginia newspapers, however, uncovered that six of the alleged victims were not lynched after all. These six
non-victims were all white men.

The Beck-Tolnay inventory listed two white brothers, [J. B. Prince](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1881122602/) and [J. H. Prince](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1881122601/),
killed when a mob burned down a store on December 26th, 1881 in Green
Plains, Southampton County. The Prince brothers, however, were merely
the owners of the store. The article from the *Staunton Spectator* shown
in figure 2 reported that two young clerks, John Murrell and Thomas
Glover, perished because of the fire, but this was not the result of a
lynching mob.

![Image of newspaper article from the Staunton Spectator]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/defazio/figure2.png)
{% endfigure %}

While there were rumors of a possible lynching for the perpetrators of
the arson (*not* of the Prince brothers), no further information has
been found regarding this event.

Both Brundage and the Beck-Tolnay inventory indicated [David Thomas](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1880100802/), a 16-year-old white youth, as a victim of a double lynching that allegedly took place on October 8th, 1880 in Nelson county. Thomas and his
brother-in-law George Lowry (also white) were accused of robbery and
attempting an outrage on a young white woman.

![Image of newspaper article from the Richmond Daily Dispatch]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/defazio/figure3.png)
{% endfigure %}

After their arrest, a mob seized [Lowry](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1880100801/)
from the Nelson county jail and hung him to a nearby oak tree
([*Alexandria Gazette*](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/files/2018/03/Alexandria-gazette_10-16-1880_2__ran-away_David-Thomas_Nelson_CLIP.jpg)).
However, the *Daily Dispatch* of Richmond reported that the mob only
lynched Lowry and spared the young Thomas. A few months later, Thomas
was tried and sentenced to six years in prison for robbery.

![Image of newspaper article from the Richmond Daily Dispatch]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/defazio/figure4.png)
{% endfigure %}

Two white men, [Evan Griffith](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1883012201/)
and [O. F. Ferrall](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1883012202/),
were accused of cattle theft by deception and allegedly lynched in
Russell County on January 22nd, 1883, as per the Beck-Tolnay inventory.
The *Alexandria Gazette* partially confirmed this story on January 25th.

{% figure caption: "Figure 5. *Alexandria Gazette*, January 25, 1883, p. 2." %}
![Image of newspaper article from the Alexandria Gazette]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/defazio/figure5.png)
{% endfigure %}

However, a few days later, both the [*Daily Dispatch*](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/files/2018/03/Daily-Dispatch_01-26-1883_1__Did-Not-Occur_Evan-Griffith_Russell_CLIP.jpg) and the [*Shenandoah Herald*](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/files/2018/03/Shendandoah-Herald_01-31-1883_1__Did-Not-Occur_-Evan-Griffith_Russell_CLIP.jpg)
reported that a mob dragged Ferrall and Griffith from jail and took them
into the nearby woods; upon the "exhibition of ropes and threats of
hanging", the two men "disgorge(d)" the $18,000 they had stolen, thus
eschewing the lynching mob (*Daily Dispatch*).

In addition to revealing these cases where five white men were either
erroneously reported as lynching victims, or able to escape the mob,
local newspapers were instrumental in correcting the record regarding
another alleged white lynching victim: [John Dozier](http://sites.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1880021901/). A white farmer, Dozier was reported as lynched by his neighbors in 1880 in
Norfolk County; instead, it was his employee, an unnamed African
American man, that was killed. Infuriated about his neighbor's cattle
trespassing on his property, Dozier "revenged himself by shooting the
trespassing cattle" (*Shenandoah Herald*). On the night of February
19^th^, 1880, the cattle owners retaliated by firing at least 100
bullets into his home. As Dozier and his employee, an African American
man, ran towards the woods trying to take cover, the neighbors kept
shooting at them, slightly wounding Dozier. His employee, however, was
shot in the abdomen and died the next day. No one was immediately
arrested, and it is unknown if any legal action was taken afterwards
against the lynchers.

{% figure caption: "Figure 6. *Shenandoah Herald*, February 25, 1880, p. 2." %}
![Image of newspaper article from the Shenandoah Herald]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/defazio/figure6.png)
{% endfigure %}

Thanks to this new research based on local newspapers, the revised
inventory lists 83 black men (79%), one black woman, one white woman and
19 white men (18%) as lynched in Virginia between 1877 and 1927.[^23]
All six cases of overcounting are concentrated in a relatively short
temporal span (between 1880 and 1883); however, it would be difficult to
connect overcounting to a certain newspaper or region, as the numbers
involved here are too small. Aside from all being white newspapers,
there is little in common across them in terms of their attitude towards
lynching, readership or geographical location. Mundane news routine
constraints (e.g., getting correct information and writing under strict
deadlines) are probably the best explanations for these idiosyncrasies.

### Correcting the record

The *Racial Terror* database unveils that 1 in
5 lynching victims in Virginia were white, and not 1 in 4 as previously
reported. Why were white victims overcounted in Virginia? One possible
explanation relates to how national newspapers in the South, but also
for a certain time in the North, used the lynching of white men as a
justification for lethal mob violence. In fact, these lynchings were
used as "proof" that all criminals, and not just black men, were the
target of "popular justice". Mob violence might be at times unwarranted,
but it had little to do with race; instead, lynching was an
understandable, if sometimes regrettable, answer to atrocious crimes
that a weak and ineffective criminal justice system was unable to handle
properly.[^24] Differently from the obsessive coverage of the lynching
of "black brutes," white lynching victims were simply fodder to justify
lethal mob violence. Once these stories of white lynching victims were
published, national newspapers had few resources or incentives to follow
up on them, let alone correct the record of white lynchings.[^25] Local
newspapers, on the other hand, were more likely to keep covering these
localized events, and thus more likely to correct eventual
misreporting.[^26]

The overcounting of white victims in Virginia raises the question of
whether this was just a Virginia oddity, or a more general
methodological issue concerning inventories based on national
newspapers. Only systematic research using local newspapers and archives
in each state can address this question.[^27] Would this pattern be
confirmed, it would suggest that the lynching of white victims was even
less common than previously imagined, further corroborating the
racialized nature of lethal mob violence in the South as an instrument
of white supremacy. Researching local newspapers and archives should
thus be part of any strategy to confirm the actual occurrence of a
lynching, especially as scholars strive to compile a unified national
lynching database.[^28] Ultimately, local newspapers enrich the
information about the circumstances of each lynching, enhancing our
understanding of how racialized terrorism came to define the Jim Crow
South. Digital history projects that make this information readily
available to the public and researchers advance this goal through its
open nature and engagement with local knowledge and communities.
