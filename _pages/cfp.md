The Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media invites submissions for the second annual [*Current Research in Digital History*](http://crdh.rrchnm.org/) conference. Submissions should offer historical arguments and interpretations rather than showcase digital projects. The format of short presentations provides an opportunity to make arguments on the basis of ongoing research in larger projects. Graduate students are encouraged to submit proposals. Some travel funding for presenters is available. Presentations will be peer-reviewed and published in an online publication that accommodates dynamic visualizations and narrative.

**Submissions due:** <del>September 28, 2018.</del> The deadline has been extended to October 15, 2018. E-mail submissions as a PDF or URL to [lincoln+crdh@lincolnmullen.com](mailto:lincoln+crdh@lincolnmullen.com). Questions may be sent to the same address. 

**Format:** Each presentation will be 10 minutes in length. Proposals must include the full text (no more than 2000 words) and accompanying visualizations or websites to be presented. Papers can include multiple authors. Submissions can be either a single presentation or a session of two presentations. Proposals may suggest a commentator but are not obliged to.

The conference will feature sessions sponsored by the [African American Intellectual History Society](https://www.aaihs.org/) and the [Colored Conventions Project](http://coloredconventions.org/). Special consideration will be given to other papers on Black digital history related to the sponsored sessions.

**How papers will be selected:** The primary criterion by which these presentations and panels will be judged is whether they advance historical argumentation. In other words, while digital methods will be common to all the presentations, we will select presentations that show how those methods have advanced specific interpretations of history.

-   Submissions are due by September 28, 2018.
-   Accepted proposals will be returned with reviews provided by the
    program committee on December 14, 2018.
-   Revised versions of accepted papers will be due to the session
    commentator by February 1, 2019. Commentators will provide an
    additional review at the conference on March 9, 2019.
-   A final revised version of the paper for publication will be due on
    May 24, 2019.

**Travel funding:** Four \$200 stipends are available to support the
participation of presenters who have to travel to the event. Please
indicate on your submission if you wish to be considered for a stipend.
