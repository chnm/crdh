*Current Research in Digital History* is an annual open-access, peer-reviewed publication of the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/) at [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/). Its primary aim is to encourage and publish scholarship in digital history that offers discipline-specific arguments and interpretations. By featuring short essays, it also seeks to provide an opportunity to make arguments on the basis of ongoing research in larger projects.

Essays published in *CRDH* are first presented at an annual one-day [conference](/conference/) at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia. Authors submit their essays in the fall, and then the conference is held in the spring. Each essay goes through two rounds of peer review, first by the conference program committee, and then by the conference commentator. *CRDH* is published at the end of August, less than a year after essays are submitted.

The platform for *Current Research in Digital History* offers the
following features in order to effectively publish a range of
scholarship:

-   publication of visualizations, graphics, and narratives
-   publication of associated data or code in a research compendium
-   external hosting of content if necessary, provided that authors
    agree to maintain the content
-   DOIs and other metadata for all articles
-   indexing in Google Scholar and other academic databases

*CRDH* is funded by donations to the RRCHNM Director's Fund. Members of the program committee, commentators and participants in the conference plenary roundtable are paid small stipends to recognize the time they commit. Four $200 stipends are available to support the participation of presenters who have to travel to the conference. You can [donate to support *CRDH*](http://advancement.gmu.edu/ihm02).

### Journal Policies

**Peer Review**:
A process of peer review gives academic standing to these short works. Accepted proposals will be first be returned with written reviews provided by the program committee. A revised copy based on these reviews is due before the author’s conference presentation. Finally, the author’s conference session commentator will provide an additional oral and written review which must be taken into consideration in the author’s final revised submission for publication. 

**Open Access**:
This journal is open access. Users may read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text of these articles. This journal does not charge article processing fees or submission fees. We do not provide download statistics, but authors can find how their work is being cited in sources such as Google Scholar. 

**Copyright**:
Authors will receive a publication agreement after their final submission has been accepted. Authors retain copyright in their articles. Articles in CRDH are published under the Creative Commons BY-NC-ND license.

**Relationship to Other Publications**:
Submissions should not currently be under consideration by or already published in substantially similar form by another journal or publication. However, CRDH does aim to encourage authors to publish early versions of their work in this venue, and then develop them into fuller form for publication later. If you have any questions about whether your article is suitable for CRDH, please contact the editors.

### Author Guidelines
For your initial submission to CRDH, please follow the requirements listed in the CFP. These guidelines are for articles which have been accepted for publication and which are going through the process of being published on the CRDH website. 

**Content**: 
Submissions should offer historical arguments and interpretations, and engage with the historiography rather than simply showcase digital projects. The format of short presentations and articles provides an opportunity to publish early findings and make arguments on the basis of ongoing research from larger projects. The best submissions will show how digital methods have advanced specific interpretations of history. Therefore, submissions should not only seek to engage with specialists in digital history, but also with those in one’s content area of historical inquiry.

**Language and Length**:
Submissions should be written in English and should not exceed 3,000 words. Notes, illustrations, figure captions, and appendices do not count against this word limit.

**Citation Style**:
We use the Chicago Manual of Style shortened notes and bibliography format. In addition to the shortened notes, please include a bibliography with an entry for each source cited. Include a DOI for each bibliography entry whenever possible. This provides a permanent link to the source, and aids in citation tracking and re-use monitoring.

**File Type**:
Please send your final revised submission as an .html or .docx file.

**Figures: Images and Visualizations**:
- Our online mode of publication means that we are able to accommodate still images, as well as the dynamic visualizations and narratives that are an increasingly core element of digital scholarship. 
- Make sure that each visualization (chart, graph, table, etc.) has a descriptive title at the top. Unlike in a print journal, these titles need embedded in the visualization or image file. Embedded titles are not required for photographs or images of historical documents. 
- All figures and visualizations must be submitted as separate files (not solely embedded in the text of your article) in the highest resolution possible. Still images should be submitted as .jpg or .png files. For basic interactive visualizations such as a map or video clip, authors should submit a URL. Authors should contact CRDH if they have specific concerns about their files.
- In the body of your text, please clearly indicate to us the location where you would like each figure to appear. Also, please make sure to include call outs in your text that direct readers to look at your figures. (Ex. As the histogram in figure 1 shows…) 

**Figure Captions**:
Each figure (chart, graph, table, visualization, etc.) should have a caption. We encourage authors to include captions of up to three to four sentences for each of their figures. Captions should help the figures to be read on their own without reference to the body of the paper. Captions should tell the readers what trend/pattern/anomaly the readers should be seeing, and what it means. Captions should be submitted as a separate text-only .docx file.

**Code and Datasets**:
In order to facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, and support long-term preservation, we strongly encourage the submission of any associated data or code. This will be published as a research compendium to the original submission and will be available as a direct download from the CRDH website. We suggest that authors submit one ZIP file for their data and another for their code, along with a README.txt explaining what is contained in the files and how to re-run the code.

**ORCID**:
Authors should also send an ORCID (the alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies an author and scholar) with their final submission. Authors without an ORCID can register for one at https://orcid.org/. 

**Final Submission Details**:
After submitting a final draft of their article, authors will be contacted about production details and will be given a chance to proofread their article prior to its publication. Therefore, all corresponding authors must provide an email where they can be reached over the summer.
