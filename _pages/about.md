*Current Research in Digital History* is an open-access, peer-reviewed publication of the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/) at [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/). Its primary aim is to encourage and publish scholarship in digital history that offers discipline-specific arguments and interpretations, rather than simply showcase digital projects. By featuring short essays, it also seeks to provide an opportunity to make arguments on the basis of ongoing research in larger projects.

The platform for *Current Research in Digital History* offers the
following features in order to effectively publish a range of
scholarship:

-   publication of visualizations, graphics, and narratives
-   publication of associated data or code in a research compendium
-   external hosting of content if necessary, provided that authors
    agree to maintain the content
-   DOIs and other metadata for all articles
-   indexing in Google Scholar and other academic databases

### Journal Policies

**Peer Review**:
Two rounds of peer review gives academic standing to these short works. Given that these are brief articles about work in progress, we are committed to a fast peer review and publication schedule. Submissions are first reviewed by members of the editorial board. Accepted submissions will be returned with written reviews. After revisions are made in response to these inital reviews, a revised copy of the submission is sent to a second reviewer, who will provide a second written review. Both sets of reviews should be taken into consideration when authors prepare the final version of their article for publication. 

**Rolling Publication**:
Articles are published individually on a rolling basis, when they are ready for publication, instead of being published as a set of articles once a year.

**Open Access**:
This journal is open access. Users may read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text of these articles. This journal does not charge article processing fees or submission fees. We do not provide download statistics, but authors can find how their work is being cited in sources such as Google Scholar. 

**Copyright**:
Authors will receive a publication agreement after their final submission has been accepted. Authors retain copyright in their articles. Articles in CRDH are published under the Creative Commons BY-NC-ND license.

**Relationship to Other Publications**:
Submissions should not currently be under consideration by or already published in substantially similar form by another journal or publication. However, *CRDH* does aim to encourage authors to publish early versions of their work in this venue, and then develop them into fuller form for publication later. If you have any questions about whether your article is suitable for *CRDH*, please contact the editors.
