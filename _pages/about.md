*Current Research in Digital History* is an annual open-access, peer-reviewed publication of the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/) at [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/). Its primary aim is to encourage and publish scholarship in digital history that offers discipline-specific arguments and interpretations. By featuring short essays, it also seeks to provide an opportunity to make arguments on the basis of ongoing research in larger projects.

Essays published in *CRDH* are first presented at an annual one-day [conference](/conference/) at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia. Authors submit their essays in the fall, and then the conference is held in the spring. Each essay goes through two rounds of peer review, first by the conference program committee, and then by the conference commentator. *CRDH* is published at the end of August, less than a year after essays are submitted.

*CRDH* is funded by donations to the RRCHNM Director's Fund. Members of the program committee, commentators and participants in the conference plenary roundtable are paid small stipends to recognize the time they commit. Four $200 stipends are available to support the participation of presenters who have to travel to the conference. You can [donate to support *CRDH*](http://advancement.gmu.edu/ihm02).
