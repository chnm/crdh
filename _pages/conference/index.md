The annual *Current Research in Digital History* conference features one plenary session: a roundtable with four leading scholars on the state of digital history. This year's conference features two panels sponsored by the [African American Intellectual History Society](https://www.aaihs.org/) and the [Colored Conventions Project](http://coloredconventions.org/). The remainder of the sessions will consist of panels and presentations advancing historical argumentation. Panels can be on any historical topic or time period. Each session will consist of two 10-minute presentations, with comment from a respondent and the audience. The final time slot will be devoted to sessions proposed on the day by participants at the event, responding to the work that has been presented.

After revisions, presentations will be published in a peer-reviewed online open access journal. This publication offers a means of capturing the short form work presented at conferences and giving it academic standing by peer reviewing it. These conference proceedings will enable scholars to publish early findings from larger projects. Peer review will be provided by the program committee of digital historians as part of the acceptance of submitted papers, and then by the session commentator at the event. Publishing online accommodates the dynamic visualizations and narratives that are an increasingly core element of digital scholarship.
