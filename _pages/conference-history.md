*CRDH* began as a publication linked to an annual one-day conference held at George Mason University, with the support of the Department of History and Art History and the RRCHNM Directorâ€™s Fund. Accepted submissions were peer-reviewed by a program committee and revised prior to the conference. A commentator at the conference provided a second round of peer review. The conference also featured a plenary roundtable of four scholars discussing the state of digital history. Conferences were held in 2018 and 2019. Beginning in 2020, the editors made the decision to move to the more sustainable model of a journal with rolling publication. The conference is no longer being held.
